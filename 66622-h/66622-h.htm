1</span>PROLOGUE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BRIDE</span></h2>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
man of reverend age,<br />
But stout and hale . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
<p>A wife&rsquo;s be the cheapest ov hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">William
Barnes</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sale was over: live stock,
implements, corn and hay, turnips and potatoes, even apples, had
duly been entered to their various buyers; and now such smaller
articles as milk-pails, cheese-tubs, cream-tins, weights and
scales, and other items of a dairy-farmer&rsquo;s gear were
passing under the hammer.&nbsp; The auction had been well
attended, for it had been known beforehand that things would go
cheap, and though the melancholy circumstances under which the
sale took place called forth many expressions of regret and
compassion, they in no way lessened the general eagerness to
secure good bargains.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Old Giles
Stelling had always kept pace with the times, and had been among
the first to adopt new appliances and avail himself of the lights
which advancing science throws even upon the avocations of the
farmer.&nbsp; He had gone a little too fast, as his neighbours
now agreed with many doleful &lsquo;ah&rsquo;s&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ayes&rsquo; and shakings of heads.&nbsp; All these grand
new machines of his had helped to precipitate the catastrophe
which had overtaken him&mdash;a catastrophe which was tragic
indeed, for the old farmer, overcome by the prospect of impending
ruin, had been carried off by an apoplectic fit even before this
enforced sale of his effects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though many considered these strange new-fangled
reapers-and-binders, these unnatural-looking double-ploughs, a
kind of flying in the face of Providence, a few spirited
individuals had made up their minds to bid for them, and one
energetic purchaser had even driven eighteen miles from the other
side of the county to secure one particularly complicated
machine.</p>
<p>The bidding was still proceeding briskly in the great barn
when this person shouldered his way through the crowd and made a
tour of inspection of the premises, previous to <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>setting forth
again on his return journey.&nbsp; He was a middle-sized elderly
man, with bright blue eyes that looked forth kindly if keenly
from beneath bushy grizzled brows; the ruddy face, set off by a
fringe of white beard and whisker, looked good-humoured and
prosperous enough, but the somewhat stooping shoulders bore
witness to the constant and arduous labour which had been Elias
Fiander&rsquo;s lot in early life.</p>
<p>He sauntered across the great yard, so desolate to-day albeit
crowded at the upper end nearest the barn; the suspension of the
ordinary life of the place gave it an air of supreme melancholy
and even loneliness.&nbsp; The cattle thrusting at each other in
their enclosures and bellowing dismally, the sheep hurdled off in
convenient lots, the very fowl penned up and squawking
lamentably, for the more valuable specimens were tied together in
bunches by the legs&mdash;all these dumb things seemed to have a
kind of instinctive understanding that something unusual and
tragic was going forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor beasts, they do make a deal o&rsquo; noise,&rsquo;
muttered Elias half aloud; &lsquo;a body might think they was
a-cryin&rsquo; for their master.&nbsp; Well, well, &rsquo;t is an
ill wind what blows nobody <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>good, and that there turnip-hoer was a
wonderful bargain.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t do him no harm as I
should ha&rsquo; picked it up so cheap.&nbsp; Nay, nay, &rsquo;t
won&rsquo;t do him no harm where he be gone to; and I might as
well ha&rsquo; bought it as another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having satisfied a passing twinge of conscience with this
reflection, he stepped into the great rickyard, and stood a
moment gazing from one to the other of the golden and russet
stacks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prime stuff!&rsquo; he muttered to himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That be real old hay in the corner, and this here
wheat-rick&mdash;there&rsquo;s a goodish lot o&rsquo; money in
that or I&rsquo;m much mistaken.&nbsp; Here be another, half
thrashed&mdash;ah, fine stuff.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a pity the poor
old master did n&rsquo;t live to see the end o&rsquo; that
job&mdash;though if the money were n&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; into
his own pocket he wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been much the better
for &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was wandering round the rick in question, gazing at it from
every point, and even thrusting his hands upwards into the
loosened sheaves of that portion which had been unroofed and
partially thrashed, when a sudden rustle close to him made him
start.</p>
<p>Lo! perched high upon the ledge of the half-demolished stack a
figure was standing, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>knee-deep among the roughly piled-up sheaves, the tall
and shapely figure of a young girl.&nbsp; She was dressed in
black, and from under the wide sombre brim of her straw hat a
pair of blue eyes looked down fiercely at the farmer.&nbsp; The
face in which they were set was oval in shape, and at that moment
very pale; the lips were parted, showing a gleam of white
teeth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear,&rsquo; said Fiander, stepping a little
further away from the stack and gazing up at her in mild
astonishment&mdash;&lsquo;why, whatever might you be doin&rsquo;
up there?&nbsp; You did gi&rsquo; me quite a start, I do assure
ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m looking at something I don&rsquo;t like to
see,&rsquo; returned the girl in a choked voice; and her bosom
heaved with a quick angry sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the other tentatively.&nbsp; Setting
his hat a little further back on his head and wrinkling up his
eyes he examined her more closely.&nbsp; The black dress, the
wrathful, miserable face told their own tale.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do
&rsquo;low ye be somebody belongin&rsquo; to the poor old
master?&rsquo; he continued respectfully.</p>
<p>She sobbed again for all response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Fiander again, with a world of sympathy
in his blue eyes, &lsquo;&rsquo;t is a melancholy sight for ye,
sure.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re Mr. Stelling&rsquo;s daughter very
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&lsquo;Granddaughter,&rsquo; corrected the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive, &rsquo;t is sad&mdash;&rsquo;t is
very sad for ye, miss, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d never keep
a-standin&rsquo; on the stack frettin&rsquo; yourself so, I would
n&rsquo;t, truly.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a very sad business
altogether, Miss Stelling, but you&rsquo;ll be upsettin&rsquo;
yourself worse if ye bide here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl stepped across the sheaves and drew near the edge of
the stack.&nbsp; Fiander stretched out his hand to assist her
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; he remarked encouragingly;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m main glad to see you are so sensible and ready
to take advice, Miss Stelling.&nbsp; Here, let me help ye
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and my name
is n&rsquo;t Stelling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stooping, and supporting herself with one hand against the
edge of the ledge, she swung herself gracefully down, her hat
dropping off as she did so; the face thus exposed to view proved
even younger than Fiander had anticipated, and, were he a more
impressionable man, he might well have been startled at its
beauty.</p>
<p>Even though he had attained the respectable age of fifty-eight
and had not long buried a most faithful and hard-working
helpmate, the worthy farmer was conscious of a glow of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>admiration.&nbsp; Though the girl&rsquo;s eyes were blue,
the hair and brows were distinctly dark, and the complexion of
the brunette order&mdash;a combination somewhat unusual and very
striking.&nbsp; Her figure was, as has been said, tall and
slight, yet with vigour as well as grace in every movement: she
alighted on the ground as easily and as lightly as though she had
been a bird.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done!&rsquo; ejaculated Fiander.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
what might your name be if it bain&rsquo;t Stelling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Goldring,&rsquo; she replied a little
haughtily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rosalie Goldring.&nbsp; My mother was Mr.
Stelling&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well now,&rsquo; returned the farmer, smiling
cheerfully, &lsquo;Goldring! and that&rsquo;s a pretty name
too&mdash;partic&rsquo;lar for a maid&mdash;a token I might
say!&nbsp; Rosalie did you tell me, miss?&nbsp; I do mind a song
as I used to hear when I were a boy about Rosalie the Prairie
Flower.&rsquo;&nbsp; She had picked up her hat and stood gazing
at him discontentedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose everything is sold by this time?&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear grandfather&rsquo;s mare, and the
trap, and even my cocks and hens.&nbsp; Dear grandfather! he
always used to tell me that everything in the whole place was to
be mine <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>when
he died&mdash;and now they won&rsquo;t so much as leave me the
old rooster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor maid!&rsquo; ejaculated Fiander, full of
commiseration, and guiltily conscious of having bought that
turnip-hoer a bargain.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is unfort&rsquo;nate
for ye, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Did n&rsquo;t your grandfather make
no provision for &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is n&rsquo;t that I mind,&rsquo; retorted
Rosalie quickly; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s seeing everything go.&nbsp;
Everything that I love&mdash;all the live things that I knew and
used to take care of&mdash;even my churn, and my
cheese-presses&mdash;granfer used always to say I was wonderful
about cheese-making&mdash;and the pails and pans out of my
dairy&mdash;everything that I kept so nice and took such pride
in.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll all go to strangers now&mdash;all
scattered about, one here, one there.&nbsp; And to-morrow
they&rsquo;ll be selling the things out of the house.&nbsp; If
they leave me the clothes I stand up in that&rsquo;ll be
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sobbed so pitifully and looked so forlorn that
Fiander&rsquo;s heart was positively wrung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My word!&rsquo; he ejaculated, &lsquo;I do &rsquo;low
it&rsquo;s hard&mdash;&rsquo;t is that, &rsquo;t is cruel hard;
what was ye thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; doin&rsquo;, my dear?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have some relations most like as &rsquo;ll be glad
to take ye in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have n&rsquo;t a relation in the world,&rsquo;
returned <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Rosalie with another sob; &lsquo;I had nobody but
grandfather.&nbsp; If I had,&rsquo; she added quickly, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I should have gone to them&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t like to be beholden to anybody.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll earn
my own bread, though I don&rsquo;t know how I shall do it;
grandfather could never bear the notion of my going to
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! and could n&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; returned Fiander,
deeply interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed.&nbsp; Of course when he was alive we never
thought of things coming to this pass.&nbsp; He always told me I
should be mistress here when he was gone, and that I should be
well off.&nbsp; Dear granfer, he grudged me nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a good education as he gi&rsquo;ed ye too!&rsquo;
observed Elias commiseratingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; I was at boarding-school for three
years.&nbsp; I can play the piano and work the crewel-work, and I
learnt French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive!&rsquo; groaned Fiander, &lsquo;and
now ye be a-thrown upon the world.&nbsp; But I was meanin&rsquo;
another kind of education.&nbsp; Cheese-making and dairy-work and
that&mdash;you was sayin&rsquo; you was a good hand at
suchlike.&rsquo;&nbsp; While he spoke he eyed her sharply, and
listened eagerly for the response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; agreed Rosalie, &lsquo;I can do all <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>that.&nbsp;
We made all kinds of cheeses every day in the winter,
&ldquo;Ramil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ha&rsquo;skim,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Blue Vinny&rdquo; and all.&nbsp; Yes, I was kept
busy&mdash;my butter always took top price in the market; and
then there were the accounts to make up of an evening.&nbsp; My
life was n&rsquo;t all play, I can tell you, but I was very
happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My missus,&rsquo; remarked Fiander, following out his
own train of thoughts&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s the second one: I
buried her a year come Michaelmas&mdash;she was a wonderful hand
at the Ha&rsquo;skim cheeses.&nbsp; A very stirring body she
was!&nbsp; I do miss her dreadful; and these here dairy-women as
ye hire they be terrible folk for waste&mdash;terrible!&nbsp; I
reckon I&rsquo;ll be a lot out of pocket this year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all have our troubles, you see,&rsquo; said Rosalie,
with tears still hanging on her black lashes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
I thank you for your kind words, sir; they seem to have done me
good.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go in, now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
want to meet any of the folk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bide a bit, my dear,&rsquo; said the farmer,
&lsquo;bide a bit!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve summat to ax ye.&nbsp; You
bain&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; of going to service, ye say, and ye
don&rsquo;t rightly know where to look for a home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie stared at him.&nbsp; He was laughing in <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>a confused,
awkward way, and his face was growing redder and redder.&nbsp;
Before she could answer he went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s your name now&mdash;it be a pretty
&rsquo;un.&nbsp; I do &rsquo;low it &rsquo;ud seem almost a pity
to change it, an&rsquo; yet if ye was to lose the name ye might
get the thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rsquo; cried she,
growing red in her turn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Goldring, you know.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a token, as
I said jist now.&nbsp; If you was to get married you would
n&rsquo;t be Goldring no more, and yet ye&rsquo;d be getting a
Gold Ring, d&rsquo;ye see&mdash;a weddin&rsquo;-ring!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Rosalie distantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I might make so bold as to ax, have ye been
a-keepin&rsquo; company wi&rsquo; any young man, miss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she returned, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for
young men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done,&rsquo; cried Fiander excitedly, &lsquo;well
done, my dear!&nbsp; That shows your spirit.&nbsp; Come, what
&rsquo;ud ye say to an old one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His blue eyes were nearly jumping out of his head, his honest
face was all puckered into smiles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;&rsquo;t is an
offer!&nbsp; Here be I, an old one, yet not so very old neither,
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and
uncommon tough.&nbsp; I wants a missus terrible bad.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a-been on the look-out for one this half-year, but I
did n&rsquo;t expect to take up with a leading article like
you.&nbsp; Well, and ye be lookin&rsquo; for a home, and ye
bain&rsquo;t a-keepin&rsquo; company wi&rsquo; nobody.&nbsp; I
&rsquo;d make ye so comfortable as ever I could.&nbsp; I &rsquo;d
not grudge ye nothing, no more than your grandfather.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a-worked hard all my life and I&rsquo;ve got together
a nice bit o&rsquo; money, and bought my farm.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s seventy head of milch cows on it now, not to speak
o&rsquo; young beasts and pigs and that.&nbsp; Ye might be missus
there, and make so many cheeses as ever ye pleased.&nbsp; How old
might ye be, my maid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eighteen,&rsquo; returned Rosalie tremulously; she had
been gazing at him with large startled eyes, but had made no
attempt to interrupt him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eighteen!&nbsp; Well, and I&rsquo;m fifty-eight.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s forty years a-tween us, but, Lord, what&rsquo;s
forty years?&nbsp; I can mind when I were eighteen year of age
the same as if &rsquo;t were yesterday, and I can mind as I did
think myself as old and as wise as I be now.&nbsp; Come, my dear,
what&rsquo;s forty year?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hale and hearty, and
I&rsquo;d be so good to ye as ever I could; and you be lonesome
and desolate&mdash;thrown upon the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>world, as I say.&nbsp; Come,
let&rsquo;s make it up together comfortable.&nbsp; Say the word,
and ye can snap your fingers at anyone who interferes wi&rsquo;
ye.&nbsp; My place is just so big as this&mdash;bigger.&nbsp;
Well, now, is it a bargain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is,&rsquo; murmured Rosalie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what else to do, and I think
you look kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Late on that same evening Mr. Fiander reached home; and after
attending to his horse and casting a cursory glance round to
ascertain that nothing had gone wrong in his absence, he betook
himself across the fields to the house of his next neighbour and
great crony, Isaac Sharpe.</p>
<p>He found his friend seated in the armchair by the chimney
corner.&nbsp; Isaac, being a bachelor-man, paid small heed to the
refinements which were recently beginning to be in vogue among
his class, and habitually sat in the kitchen.&nbsp; The old woman
who acted as housekeeper to him had gone home, and he was alone
in the wide, flagged room, which looked cheerful enough just now,
lit up as it was by the wood fire, which danced gaily on the
yellow walls, and threw gigantic shadows of the hams and flitches
suspended from the <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>great oaken beams, on the ceiling.&nbsp; He was just in
the act of shaking out the ashes from his pipe, previous to
retiring for the night, when Elias entered, and greeted him with
no small astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be it you, &rsquo;Lias?&nbsp; I were just a-goin&rsquo;
to lock up and go to roost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Elias creaked noisily across the great kitchen, and, standing
opposite Sharpe in the chimney corner, looked down at him for a
moment without speaking.&nbsp; The other tapped his pipe on the
iron hob nearest him and continued to gaze interrogatively at the
new-comer.&nbsp; He was about the same age as Fiander but looked
younger, his burly form being straight and his sunburnt face more
lightly touched by the hand of time.&nbsp; Hair, beard, and
whiskers, alike abundant, were of a uniform
pepper-and-salt&mdash;there being more pepper than salt in the
mixture; when he smiled he displayed a set of teeth in no less
excellent preservation.</p>
<p>As Elias continued to gaze down at him with an odd sheepish
expression, and without speaking, he himself took the
initiative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye called round to tell me about the sale, I
suppose?&nbsp; Well, I take it very kind of ye, &rsquo;Lias,
though I was n&rsquo;t for your goin&rsquo; after <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>that
new-fangled machine.&nbsp; I do &rsquo;low ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;
give a big price for &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His tone had a tinge of severity, and it was noticeable
throughout that his attitude towards Fiander was somewhat
dictatorial, though in truth Fiander was the older as well as the
richer man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now, nay now,&rsquo; the latter returned quickly,
&lsquo;ye be wrong for once, Isaac.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a wonderful
bargain: things was goin&rsquo; oncommon cheap.&nbsp; There was
hurdles to be picked up for next to nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I were
a-thinkin&rsquo; of you, Isaac, and a-wishin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; comed wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; Yes, hurdles was goin&rsquo;
wonderful cheap.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; come in handy for
your sheep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac grunted; since he had not thought fit to accompany his
friend, he was rather annoyed at being told of the bargains he
had missed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a long way to travel,&rsquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did you have to go into Dorchester?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay I turned off by Yellowham Hill.&nbsp;
Banford&rsquo;s about four mile out o&rsquo; Dorchester, and I
cut off a good bit that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ye&rsquo;ve a-got the hoer,&rsquo; grunted
Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you bid for anything else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I did n&rsquo;t bid for it,&rsquo; returned Elias
with <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>a
sheepish chuckle; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ve a-met with a wonderful
piece of luck out yonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, slowly rubbed his hands, chuckled again, and,
finally bending down so that his face was on a level with
Sharpe&rsquo;s, said slowly and emphatically:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isaac, you&rsquo;ll be a-hearing summat on Sunday as
&rsquo;ull surprise ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac, who from force of habit had replaced his empty pipe in
his mouth, now took it out, gaped at his interlocutor for a full
half-minute, and finally said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What be I a-goin&rsquo; to hear o&rsquo;
Sunday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Banns!&nbsp; My banns,&rsquo; announced Fiander,
triumphant, but shamefaced too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; ejaculated Isaac, in a tone of
immeasurable disgust.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye be at it again, be
ye?&nbsp; I never did see sich a man for wedlock.&nbsp; Why, this
here &rsquo;ull make the third of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; returned Elias plaintively,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s none of my fault.&nbsp; My missuses
don&rsquo;t last&mdash;that&rsquo;s where &rsquo;t is.&nbsp; I
did think the last &rsquo;un &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; done my time,
but she goes an&rsquo; drops off just at our busiest
season.&nbsp; If I be so much o&rsquo; a marryin&rsquo; man,
&rsquo;t is because the Lord in His mystreerious ways has seen
fit to deal hardly wi&rsquo; I.&nbsp; Ye know as well as me,
don&rsquo;t <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>ye, Isaac, as a dairy-farmer can&rsquo;t get on nohow
wi&rsquo;out a wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, &rsquo;t is what I&rsquo;ve always said,&rsquo;
agreed Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;There may be profit in the
dairy-farming, but there&rsquo;s a deal o&rsquo; risk.&nbsp; What
wi&rsquo; cows dyin&rsquo;, and bein&rsquo; forced to toll a
woman about, &rsquo;t is more bother nor it&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp;
Why did n&rsquo;t ye do same as me, and keep sheep and grow
roots?&nbsp; Ah, what with roots, and what with corn, a man can
get on as well that way as your way&mdash;and there&rsquo;s less
risk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve a-been brought up to it, d&rsquo;ye
see, Isaac&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; My father was a dairyman
before me&mdash;in a less way, to be sure.&nbsp; Ah, it were a
struggle for him, I tell ye.&nbsp; He did ha&rsquo; to pay
thirteen pound for every cow he rented of old Meatyard, what was
master then.&nbsp; Thirteen pound!&nbsp; Think of that.&nbsp;
Why, I used to hear him say as pounds and pounds went through his
hands before he could count as he&rsquo;d made a
penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; remarked Mr. Sharpe, with the placid
interest of one who hears an oft-told tale.&nbsp; But then
pastures and house-rent and all were counted in that&mdash;your
father paid no rent for &rsquo;em, did he?&nbsp; And Meatyard
found him in cows, and kept him in hay and oil-cake and
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; agreed Elias unwillingly; for the
enumeration of these extenuating circumstances detracted from the
picturesque aspect of the case.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, yes, he did
that, but my father he al&rsquo;ays said it were a poor way
o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; a livin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Save up,
&rsquo;Lias, my boy,&rdquo; he al&rsquo;ays did use to say to
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Save up and buy a bit o&rsquo; land for
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I scraped and scrimped and laid by; and
my first missus, she were a very thrifty body, a very thrifty
body she were.&nbsp; She put her shoulder to the wheel too, and
when old Meatyard died we bought the farm, and things did prosper
wi&rsquo; us very well since&mdash;till my last poor wife died;
then all did go wrong wi&rsquo; I.&nbsp; Aye, as I say, if I do
seem more set on matrimony than other folks, &rsquo;t is because
the Lord ha&rsquo; marked I out for &rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now you,
Isaac, never was called that way, seemingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; agreed Isaac, &lsquo;I never were a-called
that way.&nbsp; I never could do wi&rsquo; women-folk
about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seed too much of &rsquo;em when I were a
young &rsquo;un.&nbsp; Lord, what a cat-and-dog life my poor
father and mother did lead, to be sure!&nbsp; He liked a drop
o&rsquo; drink, my father did; and when he&rsquo;d had a glass
too much I&rsquo;ve seen my mother pull the hair out of his head
by handfuls&mdash;ah, that I have.&nbsp; But father, he&rsquo;d
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>never
complain.&nbsp; Soon as she &rsquo;d leave go of him he&rsquo;d
stoop down and pick up all the hair as she &rsquo;d a-pulled out
of his head.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d put it in a box&mdash;ah,
many&rsquo;s the time he&rsquo;ve a-showed it to me arter him and
her had had a fallin&rsquo; out, and he&rsquo;d say to me,
&ldquo;Never you go fur to get married, my boy,&rdquo; and
I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Nay, father,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve a-kept
my word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your poor sister kep&rsquo; house for you a good bit,
though, did n&rsquo;t she, after she lost her husband?&nbsp; And
you were uncommon fond o&rsquo; the boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it be different wi&rsquo; a
sister&mdash;particularly one as knows she have n&rsquo;t got no
right to be there.&nbsp; She were a very quiet body, poor Eliza
were.&nbsp; I were quite sorry when she and the little chap
shifted to Dorchester; but she thought she&rsquo;d do better in
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but you were a good friend to she,&rsquo;
remarked Elias, &lsquo;both to she and her boy.&nbsp; Ye paid his
passage to &rsquo;Merica arter she died, poor thing, did
n&rsquo;t ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I did pay his passage to &rsquo;Merica, and I did
gi&rsquo; him a bit o&rsquo; money in hand to start wi&rsquo;,
out there.&nbsp; Well, but you ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t told me the
name o&rsquo; your new missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rosalie Goldring is her name,&rsquo; returned Elias,
lowering his voice confidentially.&nbsp; <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&lsquo;Rosalie Goldring&mdash;nice name, bain&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Soon&rsquo;s I heard her name I took it for a kind
o&rsquo; token.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! there be a good many Goldrings Dorchester
side,&rsquo; remarked Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was that what took you
off so far away?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been a-coortin&rsquo; and
never dropped a hint o&rsquo; it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now, I never so much as set eyes on her till this
very day.&nbsp; But being so bad off for a wife, and so put about
wi&rsquo; all the waste as is a-goin&rsquo; on at my place, I
thought I&rsquo;d make sure o&rsquo; her, so I axed her.&nbsp;
And she were glad enough to take me&mdash;she&rsquo;s Giles
Stelling&rsquo;s granddaughter, d&rsquo; ye see, and she has to
turn out now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Stelling&rsquo;s granddaughter,&rsquo; repeated
Isaac with emphasis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Granddaughter?&nbsp; He must
ha&rsquo; been a terrible old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do &rsquo;low he were&mdash;old enough,&rsquo;
replied Elias hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, now I&rsquo;ve a-told
ye the news, Isaac, I think I might as well take myself home
again.&nbsp; My head be all in a whirl wi&rsquo; so much
travellin&rsquo; and one thing and another.&nbsp; Good-night to
ye, Isaac; ye must be sure an&rsquo; come over to see the new
turnip-hoer to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little more than three weeks later Fiander brought home his
bride, and Isaac Sharpe cleaned himself, and strolled up in the
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>evening to
congratulate the couple.&nbsp; Elias admitted him, his face
wreathed with smiles, and his whole person smartened up and
rejuvenated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in, Isaac, come in.&nbsp; The wife&rsquo;s gone
upstairs to get ready for supper, but she&rsquo;ll be down in a
minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you joy,&rsquo; said Sharpe gruffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Isaac, thank&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Come in
and take a chair.&nbsp; Ye may fill your pipe too&mdash;she does
n&rsquo;t object to a pipe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Who</i> does n&rsquo;t object to a pipe?&rsquo; said
Isaac staring, with a great hand on each knee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Mrs. Fiander does n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Oh, Isaac, I be
a-favoured so.&nbsp; I told you the A&rsquo;mighty had marked me
out for wedlock; well, I can truly say that this here missus
promises to be the best o&rsquo; the three.&nbsp; Wait till ye
see her, and you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m in luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac gazed at him with a kind of stolid compassion, shook his
head, deliberately filled his pipe, and fell to smoking.&nbsp;
Elias did the same, and after he had puffed for a moment or two
broke silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! ye&rsquo;ll find her most agree&rsquo;ble.&nbsp; I
did mention to her that you be used to drop in of a Sunday, and
she did make no objections&mdash;no objections at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did n&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; returned Isaac.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>that&rsquo;s a good thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused for a
moment, the veins in his forehead swelling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know but if she had made objections I should
n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; come all the same,&rsquo; he continued
presently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a-come here Sunday arter
Sunday for twenty year and more.&nbsp; It would n&rsquo;t seem
very natural to stop away now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, sure,&rsquo; agreed Fiander nervously;
&lsquo;&rsquo;t would n&rsquo;t seem at all natural.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sound of a light foot was now heard crossing the room
overhead and descending the stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That be her,&rsquo; remarked Elias excitedly.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a tall well-formed figure stood outlined
against the background of fire-lit kitchen.&nbsp; It was almost
dusk in the parlour where the two men sat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re all in the dark here!&rsquo; observed
a cheerful voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I light the lamp,
Elias?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do, my dear, do.&nbsp; This here be Mr. Isaac Sharpe,
our next neighbour, as you&rsquo;ve a-heard me talk on
often.&nbsp; Isaac, here&rsquo;s Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac wedged his pipe firmly into the corner of his mouth, and
extended a large hand; according to the code of manners prevalent
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>in that
neighbourhood, it was not considered necessary to rise when you
greeted a lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye do, mum?&nbsp; I give you joy,&rsquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>When her hand was released Mrs. Fiander sought and found lamp
and matches, and removed the shade and chimney, always with such
quick decided movements that Isaac remarked to himself
approvingly that she was n&rsquo;t very slack about her
work.&nbsp; She struck a match, bending over the lamp, and
suddenly the light flared up.&nbsp; Isaac leaned forward in his
favourite attitude, a hand on either knee, and took a good look
at the new-comer; then drawing himself back, and removing his
pipe from his mouth, he shot an indignant glance at Fiander.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, that looks more cheerful,&rsquo; remarked the
unconscious bride; &lsquo;and supper will be ready in a
minute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go and get the cloth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she vanished the new-made husband bent over anxiously to
his friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of her?&rsquo; he remarked, jerking
his thumb over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elias,&rsquo; returned his friend wrathfully and
reproachfully, &lsquo;I did n&rsquo;t expect it of ye; no, that I
did n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; At your time of life and arter <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>buryin&rsquo;
two of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Nay now, I did n&rsquo;t think it of
you.&nbsp; The least you might do was to pick out a staid
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; retorted Fiander; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s
young, but that&rsquo;ll wear off, Isaac&mdash;she&rsquo;ll mend
in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It bain&rsquo;t only that she be young,&rsquo; resumed
Sharpe, still severe and indignant.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I do think,
&rsquo;Lias, takin&rsquo; everything into consideration, that it
&rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been more natural and more decent, I might
say, for you to ha&rsquo; got married to somebody more suited to
ye.&nbsp; Why, man, your new missus be a regular
beauty!&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> noontide; and a warm Sunday
too.&nbsp; The little congregation pouring out of the ivy-grown
church in the hollow seemed to have found the heat within
oppressive; the men were wiping their moist brows previous to
assuming the hard uncompromising hats which alone could do
justice to the day, and the women fanned themselves with their
clean white handkerchiefs, or sniffed ostentatiously at the
squat, oddly shaped bottles of smelling-salts, or nosegays of
jessamine and southernwood, with which they had provided
themselves.&nbsp; In the village <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>proper sundry non-churchgoers waited
the return of their more pious brethren; one or two lads sat
expectantly on stiles, on the look-out for their respective
sweethearts, whom they would escort homewards, and with whom they
would possibly make appointments for a stroll at some later hour
of the day.&nbsp; Children, with important faces, might be seen
returning from the bakehouse, carefully carrying the Sunday
dinner covered with a clean cloth; and a few older men and women
stood about their doorsteps, or leaned over their garden gates,
with the intention of waylaying their homeward-bound neighbours
and extracting from them items concerning a very important event
which had recently taken place in the vicinity.</p>
<p>One very fat old lady, propping herself with difficulty
against the lintel of her door, hailed her opposite neighbour
eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-day, Mrs. Paddock.&nbsp; Did ye chance to notice
if master have a-gone by yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, he have n&rsquo;t a-come this way&mdash;not so far
as I know,&rsquo; returned the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;They do say he
takes on terrible about poor Mr. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the first speaker with a long-drawn
breath, &lsquo;he&rsquo;d be like to, I do &rsquo;low, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>seein&rsquo;
what friends they was.&nbsp; Folks d&rsquo; say as Fiander have
very like left him summat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay, he&rsquo;ll leave it all in a lump to
she.&nbsp; He thought the world of the missus.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
be sure to ha&rsquo; left it to she&mdash;wi&rsquo;out she
marries again.&nbsp; Then&mdash;well, then, very like Mr. Sharpe
will come in.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Fiander, &rsquo;t is a sad thing to
ha&rsquo; never chick nor child to leave your money
to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, sure, &rsquo;t is a pity they did n&rsquo;t have no
children.&nbsp; I reckon Mr. Fiander looked to have &rsquo;em,
seein&rsquo; he&rsquo;d picked out such a fine shapely
maid.&nbsp; He were a fine man too, though he were gettin&rsquo;
into years, to be sure, when he wed her.&nbsp; Not but what a
body &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; expected the old gentleman to last a
good bit longer.&nbsp; Sixty-two they d&rsquo; say he
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and that&rsquo;s no age to speak on!&nbsp; Lord,
I were that upset when I heerd he were took I&rsquo;m not the
better of it yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, &rsquo;t is a terrible visitation!&nbsp; All as has
hearts must feel it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do assure ye, Mrs. Belbin, I&rsquo;ve scarce closed
my eyes since, and when I do drop off towards mornin&rsquo; I do
dream&mdash;&rsquo;t is fearful what I do dream!&nbsp; This very
night, I tell ye, I thought the End had come, and we was all
a-bein&rsquo; judged yon in church.&nbsp; The Lord <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>A&rsquo;mighty Hisself was a-sittin&rsquo; up in gallery
a-judging of we&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me,&rsquo; interrupted Mrs. Belbin, &lsquo;and
what were A&rsquo;mighty God like to look on, Mrs.
Paddock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, He were beautiful&mdash;wi&rsquo; broad large
features and a very piercin&rsquo; eye&mdash;but He had a
beautiful smile.&nbsp; I thought, if ye can understand, that some
was a-goin&rsquo; up to the right and some to the left.&nbsp;
Yes, we was all bein&rsquo; judged, taking our turns.&nbsp;
Squire fust, and then his lady, and then all the young ladies and
gentlemen a-goin&rsquo; up one after t&rsquo; other and
a-bein&rsquo; judged&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; commented Mrs. Belbin, throwing up
her eyes and hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;All so natural like, wa&rsquo;
n&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had evidently been much impressed by the strict order of
precedence observed by the actors in this visionary drama.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then I seed farmers a-goin&rsquo;
up&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did ye see poor Farmer Fiander?&rsquo; inquired the
other eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay.&nbsp; He were n&rsquo;t there, strange to
say.&nbsp; &rsquo;T &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been natural to see
him&mdash;him bein&rsquo; dead, ye know&mdash;but he were
n&rsquo;t there.&nbsp; But I see master a-bein&rsquo;
judged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did ye, now? and where did he go?&nbsp; <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>He&rsquo;s a
good man&mdash;he &rsquo;d be like to go up&rsquo;ards.&nbsp;
Were Hamworthy there&mdash;the butcher, I mean?&nbsp; I wonder
what the A&rsquo;mighty &rsquo;ud say to the short weights that
he do give us poor folk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I did n&rsquo;t see him, fur it were
a-comin&rsquo; nigh my turn, and I were that a-feared I could
n&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else.&nbsp; And when I did
get up to walk up under gallery I thought my legs did give way
and down I plumped&mdash;and that did awaken me up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it was a wonderful dream, Mrs. Paddock.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not surprised as you be feelin&rsquo; a bit poorly
to-day.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is astonishing what folks d&rsquo; dream
when they&rsquo;re upset.&nbsp; I do assure ye when my
stummick&rsquo;s a bit out of order I&rsquo;m hag-rid all
night.&nbsp; Last Sunday &rsquo;t was, I did dream I seed a great
big toad sittin&rsquo; on piller, and I hollered out and hit at
him, and Belbin he cotched me by the hand, &ldquo;Good
gracious!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what be&rsquo;st thumpin&rsquo;
me like that for?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;bain&rsquo;t there a toad on piller?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo; at all; but you&rsquo;ve a-hit me sich a crack upon
the chops that I&rsquo;ll lay I&rsquo;ll have the toothache for a
week.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d never go for to say as dreams did n&rsquo;t
mean summat, though,&rsquo; said Mrs. Paddock.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&lsquo;Aye, I&rsquo;ve great faith in dreams and tokens
and sich.&nbsp; Ye mind old Maria Gillingham?&nbsp; Folks always
used to think her a bit of a witch, but she never did nobody much
harm seemingly.&nbsp; It were but the day before she died as I
did meet her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look poorly, Maria,&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be like to be poorly, Mrs. Paddock,&rdquo; says
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m near my end,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I &rsquo;ve had a token.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I were a-sittin&rsquo; in chimbly corner just
now, and three great blue-bottles did come flyin&rsquo; in
wi&rsquo; crape upon their wings, and they did fly three times
round my head, and they did say, <i>Soon gone</i>!&nbsp; <i>Soon
gone</i>!&nbsp; <i>Soon gone</i>!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; commented Mrs. Belbin, &lsquo;and she were
soon gone, were n&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She were,&rsquo; agreed Mrs. Paddock
lugubriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;They did find her lyin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; her head under the table next day, stone dead. . .
.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s Rose Bundy a-comin&rsquo; down the
road.&nbsp; Well, Rose, was the widow in church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, I seed her,&rsquo; cried Rose, a fat red-cheeked
girl, with round black eyes at this moment gleaming with
excitement.&nbsp; &lsquo;She did have on such lovely
weeds&mdash;ye never saw such weeds.&nbsp; There was crape on
&rsquo;em very <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>nigh all over.&nbsp; She did have a great long fall as
did come to her knees very near, and another much the same
a-hanging down at the back o&rsquo; her bonnet, and her skirt was
covered with crape&mdash;and I think there was truly more black
than white to her han&rsquo;kercher.&nbsp; Ah, it was
a-goin&rsquo; all the time under her veil&mdash;fust her eyes and
then her nose.&nbsp; Poor thing! she do seem to feel her loss
dreadful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And well she may,&rsquo; said Mrs. Paddock
emphatically.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good husband same as Fiander
bain&rsquo;t to be picked up every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he was but a old man,&rsquo; retorted the
girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;ll soon have plenty
o&rsquo; young chaps a-comin&rsquo; to coort her; they d&rsquo;
say as Mr. Fiander have a-left her every single penny he had, to
do what she likes wi&rsquo;!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll soon take up
wi&rsquo; some smart young fellow&mdash;it is n&rsquo;t in
natur&rsquo; to expect a handsome young body same as her to go on
frettin&rsquo; for ever after a old man, let him be so good as he
may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now, nay now,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Belbin
authoritatively, &lsquo;&rsquo;t will be this way, as
you&rsquo;ll soon see.&nbsp; Mr. Fiander will ha&rsquo; left the
widow his money and farm and all, as long as she do be a widow,
but if she goes for to change her state, why then o&rsquo; coorse
it&rsquo;ll go to somebody <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>else.&nbsp; There never was a man
livin&rsquo;&mdash;and more particularly a old one&mdash;as could
make up his mind to leave his money behind him for a woman to
spend on another man.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be it, ye&rsquo;ll
find.&nbsp; Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;ll keep her money as long as she
d&rsquo; keep her mournin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here be master, now,&rsquo; announced her opposite
neighbour, craning her head a little further out of the
doorway.&nbsp; &lsquo;The poor man, he do look upset and
sorrowful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of all the little party fixed themselves on the
approaching figure.&nbsp; Mr. Sharpe was clad in Sunday gear of
prosperous broadcloth, and wore, somewhat on the back of his
head, a tall hat so antiquated as to shape and so shaggy as to
texture that the material of which it was composed may possibly
have been beaver.&nbsp; His large face was at that moment
absolutely devoid of all expression; Mrs. Paddock&rsquo;s remark,
therefore, seemed to be dictated by a somewhat lively
imagination.&nbsp; He nodded absently as the women greeted him,
which they did very respectfully, as both their husbands worked
under him, but wheeled round after he had passed the group to
address Mrs. Paddock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take those chicken off you as you was <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>a-speakin&rsquo; on if you&rsquo;ll fetch &rsquo;em up
to my place to-week.&nbsp; The fox have a-took a lot of mine, and
I be loath to disappoint my customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch &rsquo;em up, sir, so soon as I
can.&nbsp; These be terrible times, Mr. Sharpe, bain&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; Sich losses as we&rsquo;ve a-had last week!&nbsp; The
fox he &rsquo;ve a-been terrible mischeevous; and poor Mr.
Fiander&mdash;he were took very unexpected, were n&rsquo;t
he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; agreed Mr. Sharpe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be the one to miss him, sir.&nbsp; As we
was sayin&rsquo;, Mrs. Belbin and me, Mr. Sharpe &rsquo;ull be
the one to miss him.&nbsp; Ye did use to go there every Sunday
reg&rsquo;lar, Mr. Sharpe, did n&rsquo;t ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; agreed the farmer again.&nbsp; His large
face seemed just as expressionless as before, but a close
observer might have detected a sudden suffusion of colour to the
eyelids.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They d&rsquo; say as Mrs. Fiander be takin&rsquo; on
terrible,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Belbin, folding her arms across her
ample bosom, and settling herself for a good chat with an air of
melancholy enjoyment.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is a nice young
woman&mdash;yes, she&rsquo;s that; and the marriage did turn out
wonderful well, though folks did think it a bit foolish o&rsquo;
Mr. Fiander to choose sich a <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>young maid at his time o&rsquo;
life.&nbsp; But he was lonesome, poor man, losing his first wife
so long ago, and the children dying so young, and his second
missus bein&rsquo; took too.&nbsp; But, well, as I d&rsquo; say,
the last marriage turned out wonderful well; there was never a
word said again&rsquo; Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was never a word <i>to</i> be said,&rsquo;
returned Mr. Sharpe somewhat sternly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, just what I d&rsquo; say,&rsquo; chimed in Mrs.
Paddock.&nbsp; &lsquo;His ch&rsquo;ice was a good
&rsquo;un.&nbsp; She be a nice body, Mrs. Fiander be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; agreed the farmer, &lsquo;I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low she be a nice plain young woman.&nbsp; Her husband
have a-proved that he did think his ch&rsquo;ice a good
&rsquo;un, for he&rsquo;ve a-left her everything as he had in the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not if she marries again, sir, sure?&rsquo; cried
both the women together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard,&rsquo; added Mrs. Belbin, &lsquo;he&rsquo;d never
ha&rsquo; been sich a sammy as to let her keep everything if she
goes for to take another man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She be left house and farm, stock and money,
onconditional,&rsquo; returned Mr. Sharpe emphatically.&nbsp; And
he passed on, leaving the gossips aghast.</p>

37</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<blockquote><p>The time I&rsquo;ve lost in wooing,<br />
In watching and pursuing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light that lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In woman&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
Has been my heart&rsquo;s undoing.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Thomas
Moore</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of the conversation
recently recorded was slowly removing her &lsquo;blacks,&rsquo;
and laying them carefully away on the lavender-scented shelves in
the desolate upper chamber of the home which had suddenly grown
so lonely.&nbsp; Divested of the flowing mantle, the tall,
well-moulded figure was set off by its close-fitting black robe;
and the face, which had been hidden from view by the thick folds
of crape, proved able to stand the test of the glaring summer
sunshine.&nbsp; The adjective &lsquo;plain,&rsquo; applied to the
widow by her late husband&rsquo;s friend, must be taken only in
its local sense as signifying &lsquo;simple and
straightforward;&rsquo; even to the indifferent eyes of this
elderly yeoman Rosalie&rsquo;s beauty had ripened and increased
during the four years that had elapsed since her marriage with
his <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>friend.&nbsp; The black lashes which shaded her lovely
eyes were still wet; the red lips quivered, and the bosom heaved
convulsively.&nbsp; Most of the friends and neighbours of the
late Mr. Fiander would have been astonished&mdash;not to say
scandalised&mdash;at the sight of such grief.&nbsp; It was quite
decent and becoming to cry in church where everybody was looking
at you, but to cry when you were alone for an old man of
sixty-two&mdash;when you had been left in undisputed possession
of all his property, and might with perfect impunity marry again
at the earliest possible opportunity&mdash;it was not only
unreasonable and foolish, but rank ingratitude for the most
merciful dispensation of Providence.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Fiander continued to sob to herself, and to look
blankly round the empty room, and out at the wide fields where
the familiar figure had been wont to roam; and when, taking the
new widow&rsquo;s cap from its box, she arranged it on the top of
her abundant hair, she could not repress a fresh gush of
tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Fiander!&rsquo; she said to herself, &lsquo;he
would n&rsquo;t let me wear it if he knew.&nbsp; It makes me a
perfect fright, and is so cumbersome and so much in the
way.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll wear it <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>all the same.&nbsp; Nobody shall say
I&rsquo;m wanting in respect to his memory.&nbsp; Dear, dear, not
a week gone yet!&nbsp; It seems more like a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She descended the stairs slowly, and entered the
parlour.&nbsp; There was the high-backed chair where Fiander used
to sit waiting for the Sunday midday meal; there also was the
stool on which he supported his gouty leg.&nbsp; Opposite was
another chair, invariably occupied by Farmer Sharpe on Sunday
afternoons, when, after a walk round his neighbour&rsquo;s land,
he came in for a chat and a smoke.&nbsp; Mrs. Fiander herself had
always sat at the table, joining in the conversation from time to
time, after she had mixed for her husband and his friend the
stiff glass of grog of which it was their custom to
partake.&nbsp; Fiander said nobody mixed it so well as she, and
even Mr. Sharpe occasionally nodded approval, and generously
agreed that she was a first-rate hand.</p>
<p>She wondered idly if Mr. Sharpe would come to-day; she almost
hoped he would.&nbsp; She did not like to walk round the fields
alone&mdash;people would think it strange, too&mdash;and it was
so lonely and so dreary sitting by herself in the house.</p>
<p>But Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s chair remained empty all that
afternoon; Mrs. Fiander, however, had <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>other visitors.&nbsp; It was getting
near tea-time, and she was looking forward somewhat anxiously to
the arrival of that meal which would make a break in the dismal
hours, when a genteel knock at the door startled her.&nbsp; She
knew it was not Isaac, for it was his custom to walk in
uninvited, and thought it might be some other neighbour coming
with a word of comfort.&nbsp; She was surprised, however, when
the maid ushered in a tall, stout young man, whom she recognised
as the son of one of the leading tradespeople in the town.&nbsp;
Andrew Burge&rsquo;s father was, indeed, not only cab and coach
proprietor on a large scale, but also undertaker, and Rosalie now
remembered that her actual visitor had taken a prominent part at
her husband&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I jest called to see how you might be getting on, Mrs.
Fiander,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;and to offer my respectful
condoliences.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was a melancholy occasion where we
met last, Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was indeed,&rsquo; said Rosalie; adding, somewhat
stiffly, &lsquo;Take a seat, Mr. Burge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burge took a seat&mdash;not one of the ordinary chairs
which Mrs. Fiander indicated with a general wave of the hand, but
poor Elias&rsquo;s own particular one, which was, as has <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>been stated,
established in the chimney-corner.&nbsp; It happened to be
directly opposite to the one in which Rosalie had been
sitting&mdash;Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s usual chair&mdash;and was no
doubt chosen by the visitor on account of its agreeable proximity
to his hostess.&nbsp; Anybody more unlike its former occupant it
would be hard to imagine.&nbsp; Andrew was, as has been said,
tall and stout, with black eyes, closely resembling boot-buttons
in size and expression, a florid complexion, and very sleek black
hair.&nbsp; He conveyed a general impression of bursting out of
his clothes; his coat appearing to be too tight, his trousers too
short, his collar too high, and his hat, when he wore it, too
small.&nbsp; This hat he carefully placed upon the ground between
his legs, and drew from its crown a large white
pocket-handkerchief, which he flourished almost in a professional
manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feels,&rsquo; he went on, attuning his voice to the
melancholy tone in harmony with this proceeding&mdash;&lsquo;I
feels that any condoliences, let them be so sincere as they may,
falls immaterially short of the occasion.&nbsp; The late Mr.
Elias Fiander was universally respected by the townsfolk of
Branston as well as by his own immediate neighbours.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&lsquo;You are very kind,&rsquo; said Rosalie, feeling
that she must make a remark, and inwardly chiding herself for the
frenzied impatience with which she had longed to turn him out of
her husband&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; After all, the poor young man
was unconscious of offence, and meant well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was, I may say, Mrs. Fiander, a object of
congratulation to me that I was able to pay the deceased a last
melancholy tribute.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you did n&rsquo;t
chance to observe that it was me druv the
&rsquo;earse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew I had seen you there,&rsquo; said the widow, in
a low voice, &lsquo;but I could n&rsquo;t for the moment
recollect where.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would ha&rsquo; fallen in better wi&rsquo; my own
wishes,&rsquo; went on Andrew, &lsquo;if I could ha&rsquo; driven
both o&rsquo; you.&nbsp; But my father told me you did n&rsquo;t
fancy the notion o&rsquo; the Jubilee &rsquo;earse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that combined hearse and mourning
coach?&rsquo; cried Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, indeed!&nbsp; Why,
the coffin is put crosswise behind the driver&rsquo;s legs, just
like a bale of goods.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s
dreadful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now,&rsquo; returned Andrew, &lsquo;we are most
careful to show every respect to the pore corpse.&nbsp; The
compartment is made special&mdash;glazed, and all quite
beautiful.&nbsp; Some people <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>thinks it a privilege for the
mourners to be sittin&rsquo; behind, so close to their dear
departed.&nbsp; And then think of the expense it saves&mdash;only
one pair of horses needed, you know!&nbsp; Not but what expense
is no object to <i>you</i>; and of course, your feelin&rsquo;s
bein&rsquo; o&rsquo; that delicate natur&rsquo;, you felt, I
suppose, it would be almost too &lsquo;arrowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I could n&rsquo;t bear the idea,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The <i>Jubilee</i> hearse, do you call
it?&nbsp; How came you to give it such a name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Why, you see, it was entirely my
father&rsquo;s idea, and he had it built in the Jubilee
year.&nbsp; He thought, you know, he&rsquo;d like to do something
a little special that year by way of showin&rsquo; his
loyalty.&nbsp; Ah, he spared no expense in carryin&rsquo; of it
out, I do assure &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Well, as I was sayin&rsquo;,
Mrs. Fiander, it would have been a great pleasure to me to have
given you both a token of respect and sympathy at the same time,
but, since it was n&rsquo;t to be, I followed what I thought
would be most in accordance with your wishes, and I showed my
respect for your feelin&rsquo;s by driving the
remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he flourished the handkerchief again and raised the
boot-button eyes to Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&lsquo;I am, of course, grateful for any tribute of
respect to my dear husband,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Burge, &lsquo;I thought
you&rsquo;d look on it in that light; but I should have thought
it a privilege to drive you, Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie made some inarticulate rejoinder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just call round and explain my
motives,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;and also take the opportunity
of offering in person my best condoliences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Rosalie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may speak, I think,&rsquo; remarked Andrew pompously,
&lsquo;in the name of the whole borough of Branston.&nbsp; There
was, I might say, but one mournful murmur when the noos of his
death came to town.&nbsp; But one mournful murmur, I do assure
&rsquo;ee, Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie looked up gratefully; the young man certainly meant
well and this information was gratifying.&nbsp; She felt a little
thrill of melancholy pleasure at the thought of the universal
esteem and respect in which her poor Elias had been held.&nbsp;
But meeting the hard expressionless gaze of Mr. Burge&rsquo;s
tight little eyes, the appreciative compliment died upon her
lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So now,&rsquo; resumed the visitor, diving for <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>his hat and
carefully tucking away the handkerchief in its
lining&mdash;&lsquo;now, Mrs. Fiander, having spoken for myself
and for my fellow-townsmen, and having assured myself that you
are no worse in health than might have been expected under these
extraneous circumstances, I will withdraw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose, ducked his head, extended his hand, and solemnly
pumped Rosalie&rsquo;s up and down for about two minutes; finally
backing to the door.</p>
<p>As he let himself out he almost fell over another caller who
was at that moment raising his hand to the knocker.&nbsp; This
was a dapper gentleman of about his own age, with an alert and
sprightly air and a good-humoured, sharp-featured face.</p>
<p>Rosalie, just standing within the half-open parlour-door,
caught sight of the new-comer and wondered who he might be.&nbsp;
In a moment he had set her doubts at rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-day, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he remarked, advancing
cheerily with outstretched hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must introduce
myself, I see; I&rsquo;m not so well known to you as you are to
me.&nbsp; My name is Cross&mdash;Samuel Cross&mdash;and I am one
of Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s clerks.&nbsp; Robinson and Bradbury,
solicitors, you know&mdash;that&rsquo;s who I am.&nbsp; <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>I just called
round to&mdash;to make a few remarks with regard to certain
business matters in the hands of our firm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rsquo; said Rosalie, hastily
taking possession of her husband&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; It should
not, if she could help it, again be desecrated that day.&nbsp;
She pointed out a small one, but Mr. Samuel Cross, without
noticing the intimation, stepped quickly forward and seated
himself opposite to the widow in the chair she had just
vacated&mdash;Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; Rosalie
contemplated him with knitted brows; since Mr. Sharpe, that
trusted friend, had not thought fit to occupy his customary place
himself that afternoon, she felt ill pleased at the intrusion of
this presumptuous stranger.</p>
<p>What a callow little shrimp of a man it was, to be sure, and
how unlike, with his spare form and small narrow face&mdash;a
face which she mentally compared to that of a weasel&mdash;to the
large, bland personality of Isaac!</p>
<p>&lsquo;A matter of business,&rsquo; she said drily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am surprised that Mr. Robinson should send you on
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, this is quite an informal visit, Mrs. Fiander; not
at all official.&nbsp; I came of my own <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>accord&mdash;I may say, in my private capacity.&nbsp;
This here is n&rsquo;t a six-and-eightpenny affair.&nbsp; He!
he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Rosalie, even more drily than
before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; seeing, Mrs. Fiander, that you are left so
peculiarly lonely and desolate, I just thought to myself that it
would be only kind to call in in passing and mention that your
business matters, Mrs. Fiander, are in a most satisfactory
position.&nbsp; I have frequently heard our firm remark that they
seldom had to deal with affairs more satisfactory and
straightforward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband had a very clear head for business,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always found that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is n&rsquo;t that alone,&rsquo; rejoined the
young man, &lsquo;it is, if I may be permitted to express an
opinion, the very satisfactory manner in which he has disposed of
his property, on which I feel bound to congratulate you.&nbsp; I
called round, private as I say, jist to let you know as all was
most satisfactory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I had no doubt about it,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, surveying her visitor with increasing disfavour as he
leered at her from the depth of Isaac&rsquo;s capacious
chair.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; he pursued, with an ingratiating
wriggle&mdash;&lsquo;ladies is apt to be easily alarmed when
legal matters is under discussion.&nbsp; The very terms which
come so natural to us are apt to frighten them.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;
bless you, I des-say when Mr. Robinson do talk about testamentary
dispositions and such like it makes you feel quite nervous.&nbsp;
But &rsquo;t is only the sound of the words as is strange; the
thing itself [meaning the testamentary dispositions of the late
lamented Mr. Fiander] is, I do assure you, most
satisfactory.&nbsp; What with the freehold property,
meanin&rsquo; the farm and the money invested in such good and
safe securities&mdash;you may be sure that they are good and
safe, Mrs. Fiander; for I may ventur&rsquo; to tell you in
confidence that the late lamented used to consult our firm with
regard to his investments&mdash;I have pleasure in assuring you
that very few ladies find theirselves in so satisfactory a
position as you do find yourself to-day.&nbsp; I jist dropped in,
unofficial like, to let you know this, for, as I said to myself,
it may be a satisfaction to pore Mrs. Fiander to know <i>her</i>
circumstances, and to understand that, desolate as she may be
left, there is some compensations; and that, moreover, she has
been left absolutely free and independent, the late <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>lamented not
having hampered her by no conditions whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Cross, who had been leaning forward in his chair so
that his face, with its narrow jaws and its little twinkling
eyes, had been a good deal below the level of the slightly
disdainful countenance of his hostess, now slowly straightened
himself, clapped an exultant hand on either knee, and brought the
jaws aforesaid together with a snap.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fiander could not help contrasting him once more with the
friend who should by right be sitting opposite to her; how far
more welcome would have been the sight of the good-tempered
rubicund visage, the placid portly form!&nbsp; Even the
contented, amicable taciturnity which Mr. Sharpe usually
maintained during the greater part of his visits would have been
far more to her mind than this loquacity, which somehow seemed
unpleasantly near familiarity.&nbsp; Still, it was unreasonable
to take a dislike to the poor young man merely because he looked
like a weasel and was disposed to be a little over-friendly; no
doubt his intention was kind.</p>
<p>She thanked him, therefore, with somewhat forced politeness,
but could not repress a little forward movement in her chair
which a <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>sensitive person would have recognized as a token of
dismissal.&nbsp; Mr. Cross was not, however, of this calibre, and
prolonged his visit until his hostess&rsquo;s patience fairly
wore out.&nbsp; She rose at last, glancing at the clock, and
observing that she thought it was time to get ready for evening
church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will have the pleasure of escorting you,&rsquo;
announced Samuel promptly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>Thereupon Mrs. Fiander sat down again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On second thoughts I&rsquo;m too tired,&rsquo; she
said; &lsquo;but I will not allow you to delay any longer, Mr.
Cross&mdash;you will certainly be late as it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had no course but to withdraw then, which he did,
unwillingly enough, after tenderly pressing the widow&rsquo;s
hand and assuring her, quite superfluously, that she might depend
on him to look after her interests in every way in his power.</p>
<p>Rosalie was disconsolately polishing the hand which had
received this undesired token of interest, when the door creaked
slowly open, and a tall, gaunt, elderly female, clad in rusty
black, and wearing somewhat on the back of her head a flat black
bonnet, with the strings untied, entered the room.&nbsp; This was
Mrs. Greene, a personage generally to be met with <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>in this
neighbourhood in households whose number had recently been either
increased or diminished.&nbsp; She was equally at home, as she
once remarked, with babies and with corpses; and she filled up
the intervals by &lsquo;charing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her appearance was
so genteel, and her manner of fulfilling her various duties so
elegant, that the clergyman&rsquo;s daughter had once remarked
that she was wonderfully refined for a char-woman; the
appellation had stuck to her, and she was commonly known as the
&lsquo;refined char-woman&rsquo; among such of the
&lsquo;gentry&rsquo; as occasionally employed her in that
capacity.</p>
<p>She had come to Littlecomb Farm to &lsquo;lay out&rsquo; poor
Elias Fiander, and she was remaining on as chief factotum and
comforter.&nbsp; For it was n&rsquo;t to be supposed that the
poor young widow &rsquo;ud be eq&rsquo;al to lookin&rsquo; after
the maids&mdash;much less to turn her thoughts to doin&rsquo; for
herself.&nbsp; She now advanced slowly to the table, and after
heaving a deep sigh proceeded to lay the cloth.&nbsp; Rosalie
knew that she was burning to enter into conversation, but was too
much dispirited to encourage her.&nbsp; But by-and-by, after a
preliminary cough, Mrs. Greene remarked in a lugubrious tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lovely cap, mum.&nbsp; Everybody was
a-sayin&rsquo; that you did look charmin&rsquo; in your <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>weeds.&nbsp;
Ay, that was what they said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She do look
charming&rdquo;&mdash;that was the very thing they said;
&ldquo;&rsquo;t is a comfort, too,&rdquo; says they, &ldquo;to
see how nice she do mourn for Mr. Fiander.&rdquo;&nbsp; They was
all a-passing the remark one to the other about it,
mum&mdash;admirable they said it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; cried Rosalie wrathfully, but with a
little quaver in her voice; &lsquo;it would be very strange, I
think, if I did not grieve for such a good husband.&nbsp; I wish
people would n&rsquo;t talk about me,&rsquo; she added
petulantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talk!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Greene dismally.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah, they will talk, mum, you may depend on it.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll al&rsquo;ays talk, and perticlarly about a young
widow.&nbsp; Lord, how they did go on about me when poor Greene
died!&nbsp; They did n&rsquo;t leave so much as my
furnitur&rsquo; alone.&nbsp; Whether I could afford to keep it,
or whether I&rsquo;d be for ridden house and goin&rsquo; into
lodgin&rsquo;s, and whether I&rsquo;d put the children in an
orphanage and get married again&mdash;it was enough to drive a
body silly the way they did go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disgusting,&rsquo; cried Rosalie, now faintly
interested.&nbsp; &lsquo;The idea of talking of a second marriage
when your poor husband was only just dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&lsquo;Why, that be the first thing they&rsquo;d talk
on,&rsquo; with a kind of dismal triumph&mdash;&lsquo;more
perticlar if a woman be young and good-lookin&rsquo;.&nbsp; In
your own case, mum, I do assure ye they be all a-pickin&rsquo;
out <i>your</i> second.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s what they be
a-doin&rsquo;, but as they all picks different men they
don&rsquo;t so very well agree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Greene!&rsquo; ejaculated her mistress
indignantly, wheeling round in her chair, &lsquo;what do you
mean?&nbsp; How dare you come and repeat such things to
me&mdash;it&rsquo;s positively indecent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That be the very remark as I did pass myself to the men
yesterday,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Greene, pausing to contemplate
Mrs. Fiander with her hands upon her hips.&nbsp; &lsquo;The very
thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;t is most onbecomin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
says I, &ldquo;to be settin&rsquo; yourselves up to pry into the
affairs o&rsquo; your betters.&nbsp; Missus,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;be a-thinkin&rsquo; of nothing but her mournin&rsquo; so
far, and when she do make her ch&rsquo;ice,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll please herself and pick out him as is most
suitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Them was my words, mum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Rosalie, rising to her feet
impetuously, &lsquo;I wonder you dare to own them to me, Mrs.
Greene.&nbsp; I think that, considering you are a widow yourself,
you ought to know better than to accuse another woman of such
faithlessness.&nbsp; If you think I could <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>ever, ever
forget my good kind husband, you are much mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene coughed drily behind her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I marry again any more than you?&rsquo;
cried Rosalie, with angry tears starting to her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, mum, the cases be very different.&nbsp; Nobody
never axed I&mdash;&rsquo;t was n&rsquo;t very likely as they
should, considering I had six children and only my own labour to
keep &rsquo;em.&nbsp; As for you, mum, nobody could n&rsquo;t
think it at all strange if you was to get married
again&mdash;considerin&rsquo; everything, you know.&nbsp; Your
station in life,&rsquo; continued Mrs. Greene delicately,
&lsquo;and your not bein&rsquo; blessed with no children, and
your fortun&rsquo; and your <i>oncommon</i> looks&mdash;it
&rsquo;ud be very strange if there was n&rsquo;t a-many a-coming
coortin&rsquo; ye&mdash;and you may depend upon it they
will,&rsquo; she cried with conviction.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
seein&rsquo; how young you be, mum, and how lonesome like, I
should say it be a&rsquo;most your dooty to take a
second.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now listen to me, Mrs. Greene,&rsquo; said Rosalie very
emphatically, &lsquo;I wish to put an end to this foolish gossip
at once.&nbsp; You can tell everybody that you hear talking about
the matter that I never intend to marry again.&nbsp;
Never!&mdash;do you hear me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&lsquo;Yes, mum,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Greene, with every
feature and line of her countenance expressing disbelief,
&lsquo;I hear.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I better begin by
lettin&rsquo; them two chaps know what called here to-day.&nbsp;
I do &rsquo;low they&rsquo;ll be disapp&rsquo;inted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would n&rsquo;t talk such nonsense, Mrs.
Greene,&rsquo; cried Rosalie almost pettishly, though the colour
rushed over her face, and a startled expression showed itself for
a moment in her heavy eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go away!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to be worried any more; remember what I have
said, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>

56</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<blockquote><p>Nothing coming, nothing going&mdash;<br />
Landrail craking, one cock crowing;<br />
Few things moving up and down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All things drowsy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">North-Country
Song</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Rosalie</span> passed a very unquiet
night, and woke from a troubled sleep shortly after dawn.&nbsp;
The dead-weight of grief, ever present to her since her
bereavement, was now, as she dimly felt, supplemented by
something else&mdash;something irritating, something
unpleasant.&nbsp; As her scattered faculties returned to her she
gradually recognised that this state of feeling was produced by
several small causes.&nbsp; The two visits which she had received
yesterday, and which she had supposed to proceed from mere
officious goodwill, had, as she now acknowledged, been prompted
in all probability by aspirations as unjustifiable as they were
unseemly.&nbsp; Her subsequent interview with Mrs. Greene had
disagreeably enlightened her on this point, and had also made her
aware of the kind of <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>gossip to which she must expect to be
subjected.&nbsp; Then&mdash;all through that long, lonely, heavy
day Isaac Sharpe had not once put in an appearance.&nbsp; He, her
husband&rsquo;s faithful friend, the only real friend whom she
herself acknowledged, had not thought fit to look in for so much
as five minutes to cheer her in her desolation.&nbsp; As she
thought of these things hot tears welled afresh to her
eyes.&nbsp; Oh, how desolate she was!&nbsp; No one really cared
for her, and, what was almost worse, no one seemed to believe in
the sincerity of her affliction.</p>
<p>As she lay tossing uneasily on her pillow, and as the light
grew and brightened, and the birds&rsquo; jubilant songs mingled
with the distant lowing of cows, a new sense of disquietude came
to her, proceeding from a different and very tangible
cause.&nbsp; It was broad day&mdash;Monday morning&mdash;a
morning of exceptional importance at the farm&mdash;and no human
being seemed yet to be afoot.&nbsp; Reaching up her hand to the
old-fashioned watch-pocket which hung in the centre of the bed,
she took down Elias&rsquo;s heavy silver repeater and pressed the
spring.&nbsp; <i>Ting</i>, <i>ting</i>, <i>ting</i>, <i>ting</i>,
<i>ting</i>!&nbsp; Five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Sitting up, she sent
the two cases flying open and gazed almost incredulously at <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the dial
beneath.&nbsp; Ten minutes past five&mdash;no less!&nbsp; She
sprang out of bed and flung open her door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane!&nbsp; Susan!&nbsp; What are you about? &rsquo;t
is past five o&rsquo;clock, and churning morning.&nbsp; How did
you come to oversleep yourselves like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a muffled murmur, a thud upon the floor, a
<i>pat</i>, <i>pat</i> of bare feet across the room above, and a
door overhead opened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was ye callin&rsquo;, mum?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was I calling?&nbsp; I should think I was
calling!&nbsp; Have you forgotten what morning it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, missus, that I haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Lord,
no.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was this day se&rsquo;ennight as poor master
was buried.&nbsp; Dear, yes, so &rsquo;t was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A lump rose in Rosalie&rsquo;s throat, but she steadied her
voice and said coldly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not talking of that.&nbsp; It is churning morning,
as you know very well.&nbsp; You should have been up and about an
hour ago.&nbsp; Make as much haste as you can, now, and come
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She closed the door with just sufficient noise to indicate the
condition of her feelings, and hastened across the room to the
open window.&nbsp; Drawing the curtains apart, she <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>looked
out.&nbsp; A glorious summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Not a cloud upon
the pearly-blue expanse of sky, the leaves stirring gently in a
fresh breeze&mdash;a breeze laden with all the exquisite spicy
scents of morning: the fragrance of dewy grasses, of sun-kissed
trees, of newly-awakened flowers.&nbsp; The monthly rose-tree
climbing round her mullioned window thrust its delicate clusters
of bloom almost into Rosalie&rsquo;s face, but she pushed it
impatiently aside.&nbsp; Her eyes cast a keen glance on the
homely scene beyond.&nbsp; Above the time-worn roofs of the
farm-buildings, where the green of the moss and the mellow red
and yellow of the tiles were alike transfigured by this mystic
glow, she could see last year&rsquo;s ricks shouldering each
other, their regular outlines defined, as it were, with a pencil
of fire; the great meadow beyond, which sloped downwards till it
reached the church-yard wall a quarter of a mile away, broke into
light ripples, tawny and russet, as the breeze swept over it.</p>
<p>Surely these were sights to gladden a young heart&mdash;even a
heart that had been sorrowing&mdash;yet the expression of
Rosalie&rsquo;s eyes grew more and more discontented and
displeased, and a frown gathered on her brow.</p>
<p>The fowl were flocking impatiently about <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>the gate of
the great barn-yard; yonder, on the further side, from beneath
the tiled roof of the line of pigsties she could hear loud
vociferations; turning her eyes towards the stable-buildings
which ran at right angles to them, she could see that the doors
were fast closed, and could hear the rattling of chains and
stamping of heavy hoofs within.&nbsp; The Church Meadow ought to
have been cut to-day&mdash;the grass was over-ripe as it was; men
and horses should have been at work since three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; No figures appeared even in the
neighbourhood of the barn; and looking beyond to the barton
proper, she could see that it was empty.&nbsp; No wonder that the
lowing of the cows had sounded distant in her ears: they were
still in their pasture by the river.&nbsp; Poor creatures!
crowding round the gate, no doubt, as the fowl were doing close
at hand, all clamouring alike for the attention which was
evidently withheld from them.&nbsp; What was everyone
about?&nbsp; Why had not the men come to their work as usual?</p>
<p>She performed her toilet hastily and somewhat perfunctorily,
and when at last a sleepy-looking red-haired man came slouching
up the lane which led to the farm, he was surprised to see a
figure in rustling print and <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>broad-brimmed chip hat standing in
the midst of a bevy of cocks and hens, scattering handfuls of
grain with wide impetuous sweeps of a round, vigorous arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the hurry, Sukey?&rsquo; he
inquired pleasantly.</p>
<p>But the face which was flashed upon him was not the rosy and
somewhat vacant one of Susan, but belonged to no less a person
than Missus herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry, Job?&rsquo; she repeated
severely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like to know why there is
n&rsquo;t a little more hurry?&nbsp; What has become of all the
men?&nbsp; Has anybody gone to fetch the cows?&nbsp; What is
everyone about, I say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Job tilted his hat a little sideways on his red locks, the
better to scratch his head, and gazed at his mistress with a
puzzled and somewhat scandalised expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye must expect things to be a bit onreg&rsquo;lar for a
bit, mum,&rsquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seein&rsquo; the loss
we&rsquo;ve had, and us all bein&rsquo; so upset like about poor
master, we ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a-got the &rsquo;eart to go about
our work as if nothin&rsquo; had happened.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t
to be looked for.&nbsp; Nay now,&rsquo; he continued mildly,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; we did n&rsquo;t look to find yerself
a-goin&rsquo; about this way&mdash;we did n&rsquo;t, sure.&nbsp;
It scarce seems nait&rsquo;ral.&nbsp; If I may <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>make so bold
as to say so, it do seem&rsquo;&mdash;here Job fixed an
expostulatory glance on the angry young face that was confronting
him&mdash;&lsquo;it d&rsquo; seem scarce right, mum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Job Hunt,&rsquo; returned his mistress haughtily,
&lsquo;you are not called upon to make remarks upon my actions;
but I will tell you so much: it is my duty to see that the work
in this place is properly done, and I intend that it shall be
properly done.&nbsp; Go and call the other men at once.&nbsp;
Tell them if they are ever again so disgracefully late they shall
all be fined.&nbsp; Call them quickly,&rsquo; she added with an
imperative tap of the foot, &lsquo;and then go and fetch the
cows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she turned to re-enter the house she caught sight of Susan,
who was evidently exchanging astonished and depreciatory grimaces
with Job, while Mrs. Greene, in the background, was raising hands
and eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, get to work,&rsquo; she cried sharply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Skim the cream, Susan; and you, Jane, get the churn
ready.&nbsp; Well, Mrs. Greene, what are you staring at?&nbsp;
Have you never seen me work before, that the fact of my turning
up my sleeves need astonish you so much?&nbsp; I suppose you can
find something to do about <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the house.&nbsp; Give me that other
skimmer, Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho dear, yes, mum, I can find a plenty to do about this
here house.&nbsp; I wur but a-lookin&rsquo; at you, mum, because
it do really seem a&rsquo;most too much for flesh an&rsquo; blood
to be a-takin&rsquo; on itself as you be a-takin&rsquo; on
yourself now, mum.&nbsp; Dear, yes! but it&rsquo;s to be hoped as
ye won&rsquo;t overtax your constitootion, Mrs.
Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and clean the kitchen grate,&rsquo; said Rosalie,
beginning to skim with great rapidity and decision; &lsquo;and
see that you blacklead it properly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho yes, mum, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> blacklead it,&rsquo;
returned the elder matron, without, however, attempting to move
from the spot where she stood, and continuing to fix her eyes
mournfully on her mistress&mdash;&lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>
blacklead it right enough,&rsquo; she repeated, with a kind of
groan, after a pause, during which she had meditatively polished
first one skinny bare arm and then the other with a not
over-clean apron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, why in Heaven&rsquo;s name don&rsquo;t you go,
then?&rsquo; cried Rosalie impatiently, for she felt Mrs.
Greene&rsquo;s sorrowfully disapproving gaze right at the back of
her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be going, mum, I be going.&nbsp; If I mid <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>take the
liberty of remindin&rsquo; you, mum&mdash;&rsquo;t is your
<i>hat</i> as you&rsquo;ve a-got on your head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; inquired Rosalie, reddening ominously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; returned the char-woman with
an insinuating smile, &lsquo;would n&rsquo;t you like me to run
upstairs wi&rsquo; it now and fetch you down your cap?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied her mistress very shortly; &lsquo;if
I had wished for it I should have sent for it.&nbsp; You need not
be so officious.&nbsp; The strings would get in my way while I
worked,&rsquo; she added a little inconsequently.&nbsp; She felt
she was lowering herself by making this explanation, yet she
could not bear that even Mrs. Greene and the two maids should
think her wanting in respect to Elias&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene withdrew, murmuring under her breath that it was
to be &rsquo;oped as nobody would n&rsquo;t chance t&rsquo; look
in that morning, which was not, indeed, very likely, the hands of
the old-fashioned clock in the kitchen beyond just pointing to
the quarter-past six.</p>
<p>For some minutes nothing was heard but the clinking of the
skimmers against the sides of the vats as the rich cream, clotted
and crinkled and thick, was removed therefrom.&nbsp; The scene
was a pretty one; indeed, such a <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>dairy on such a summer&rsquo;s
morning must always hold a charm and a picturesqueness of its
own; and now that the angular presence of Mrs. Greene was removed
there was absolutely no discordant element in this cool
harmony.&nbsp; The dairy itself was a wide, pleasant room, its
buff walls and red-flagged floor throwing out the exquisite tints
of the vast tracts of cream, each marked off by its own barrier
of glancing tin, and varying in tone from the deep yellow of that
portion destined for the morning&rsquo;s churning to the warm
white of the foaming pailfuls which Job poured from time to time
somewhat sulkily into the vat nearest the door.&nbsp; Then there
was the green of the gently swaying boughs without, seen through
windows and open door, the brilliant patch of sunlight creeping
over the uneven threshold, the glint of blue sky between sunlit
green and sunlit stone.&nbsp; The brave array of glittering cans
on the topmost shelf added their own share of brightness; the
great earthenware crocks and pans, some the very colour of the
cream itself, some ruddy in tone, some of a deep rich brown, lent
also valuable aid; then there were tall white jars containing
lard, carefully-packed baskets and smooth wooden vessels <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>piled high
with eggs, little squares of filmy gauze hung out on lines in
readiness for the golden rolls of butter which they were soon to
enfold.&nbsp; The figures of the girls themselves&mdash;for the
mistress of Littlecomb Farm was no more than a girl in
years&mdash;gave the necessary and very delightful touch of human
interest.&nbsp; Susan and Jane, in cotton dresses and large
aprons so immaculate that the mere sight of them was sufficient
to recall that it was the first day of the week, were not without
a certain rustic charm of their own; as for Rosalie, standing in
the foreground, with her sleeves rolled up on her white arms, her
print dress fitting so closely to her beautiful form, the hair
hastily rolled up escaping into such exquisite curls and tendrils
round brow and ear and shapely neck&mdash;Rosalie was as ever
what her admiring old Elias had once called her&mdash;the leading
article.</p>
<p>When the churn was fairly at work, the skim-milk duly meted
out to the pigs, and the long procession of dairy cows were
sauntering back to their pasture under the guardianship of Job
and the three &lsquo;chaps&rsquo; who had till then been busily
milking, Rosalie removed her hat and sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p>The flush of annoyance still lingered on her <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>face, and,
while she ate, her glance wandered through the window to the
premises without.&nbsp; She could hear Robert Cross and James
Bundy leisurely leading out the horses, inducing them with many
objurgations to stand while they were being harnessed to the
rattling, creaking mower.&nbsp; How slow they were!&nbsp; They
should have been in the field hours ago, and yet they slouched
about as though the beautiful golden morning were not already
half over.&nbsp; Now, at last they were starting&mdash;no, here
was James coming back for something they had forgotten.&nbsp;
Rising hastily from her chair, she leaned out of the open window,
tapping impatiently on the pane.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you about,
Bundy?&nbsp; Why on earth don&rsquo;t you try and make a little
more haste?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mum?&rsquo; gasped Bundy, turning round a vacant,
weather-beaten countenance adorned with the smallest fraction of
a nose which it was possible for the face of man to possess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, why don&rsquo;t you make more haste when you
have lost so much time already?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be making so much haste as ever I can,&rsquo;
responded James, much aggrieved.&nbsp; &lsquo;I be just
a-comin&rsquo; to fetch the ile-can.&nbsp; &rsquo;T would
n&rsquo;t be no use to get to work without the
ile-can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did n&rsquo;t you think about the oil-can <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>while Cross
was harnessing the horses? &rsquo;t is nearly eight
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;you have lost half your morning&rsquo;s
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bundy looked up at the sky; then, still in an aggrieved
manner, at his mistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We was all so upset,&rsquo; he was beginning, when she
interrupted him fiercely:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hear another word about your being
upset!&nbsp; If I can attend to my business, you can attend to
yours, I should think.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is but an excuse for
disgraceful laziness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We <i>was</i> upset,&rsquo; asserted Bundy with much
dignity, &lsquo;and, as for bein&rsquo; behind, if it comes to
that we can keep on workin&rsquo; a bit later this
a&rsquo;ternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must certainly work later this afternoon; but how
long will this fine weather last, think you?&nbsp; Besides, you
know as well as I do that it is much better for the horses to
work in the early morning.&nbsp; There! get started now, and try
to make up for lost time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She returned to her breakfast, and James rejoined his
companion at a slightly accelerated pace.&nbsp; But, by-and-by,
her attention was caught by the sound of voices, apparently in
placid conversation.&nbsp; Back to the window again flew she: the
village carpenter, who was supposed to be repairing the
yard-gate, had <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>just arrived, and was leaning negligently against one of
the posts, while Abel Hunt, Job&rsquo;s brother, a large bucket
of pig-food in either hand, was leisurely talking to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will give them a few minutes,&rsquo; said Rosalie to
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;After all, I must n&rsquo;t be too hard on
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once more she went back to the table, finished her egg, and
drank her second cup of tea, the trickle of talk meanwhile
continuing without ceasing.</p>
<p>Pushing back her chair, she returned to the window
impatiently.&nbsp; The carpenter had remained in the same
attitude, without even unfastening his bag of tools; Abel had set
down his pails, and propped himself up against the other
gate-post; the pigs were wildly protesting in the background.</p>
<p>Rosalie recrossed the room hastily and went to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you intend to gossip here all day?&rsquo; she
inquired with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We was jest a-talkin&rsquo; about the melancolly
event,&rsquo; explained the carpenter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will oblige me,&rsquo; said Rosalie, &lsquo;by
keeping to your work.&nbsp; Abel, take those pails across to the
sties at once.&nbsp; Remember, I will have no more
dawdling.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Abel
took up his pails, and the carpenter unfastened his tools, the
expression of both faces alike shocked, wounded, and
astonished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If this goes on,&rsquo; murmured Rosalie to herself,
&lsquo;I shall not only break my heart, but go out of my
mind.&nbsp; Oh, Elias, you were clever as well as
kind&mdash;everything seemed to go by clock-work when you were
here&mdash;oh, why did you leave me?&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the forenoon was passed in
butter-making, and in the afternoon Rosalie betook herself to the
mead to superintend the operations of James and Robert.&nbsp; It
was not until after tea that she had leisure to change her dress
and make her way, by the well-known little footpath that skirted
the cornfields and wound across the downs, to Isaac
Sharpe&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>She found that worthy standing contemplatively in the middle
of his yard.&nbsp; There had been sheep-shearing that day, and
the master had worked as hard as any of the men; now, however,
the naked, ungainly-looking ewes had returned to their pasture,
the newly-taken fleeces lay neatly piled up in a corner of the
barn, and Isaac was at liberty to straighten <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>his weary
back, relax his muscles, and smoke the pipe of peace.</p>
<p>Tall, massive, and imposing was this figure of his, ever at
its best in the smock-frock and serviceable corduroys and
leggings of weekday wear; his wideawake, turned up at the back
and projecting in front in the orthodox shovel form, was
decidedly more becoming than the Sunday beaver.&nbsp; He started
as the yard-gate creaked upon its hinges, and Rosalie&rsquo;s
black-robed figure passed through.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he cried, hastening towards
her, &lsquo;be this you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to see ye.&nbsp; Is
there anything I can do for &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie could hardly have defined the motive which prompted
her visit; her desolate heart felt the need of sympathy; in this
strange new life of hers she yearned to find herself once more,
if but for a moment, in touch with the past.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Mr.
Sharpe,&rsquo; she said with a little gasp, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s anything you can do for me.&nbsp; I only came
because I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Mr. Sharpe, everything is going
wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac Sharpe took out his pipe and opened his eyes very
wide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;come&mdash;tell me what be
the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&lsquo;Everything&rsquo;s the matter,&rsquo; returned
the widow in a shaking voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Isaac, I
can&rsquo;t get on without Elias!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee now, my dear?&rsquo; returned
Isaac, blinking very hard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure
&rsquo;t is nat&rsquo;ral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie gave a little sob, and the farmer, stretching out a
large brown hand, patted her arm soothingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on, though,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on, my
dear.&nbsp; Cryin&rsquo; never did nobody no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so lonely,&rsquo; went on the girl
brokenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I miss him at every turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;d be like to do that,&rsquo; responded Sharpe
judicially.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear, yes&mdash;ye&rsquo;d be like to do
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything is at sixes and sevens,&rsquo; she pursued
plaintively.&nbsp; &lsquo;The men think they can do just as they
like; it was eight o&rsquo;clock before they began their mowing
this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo; ejaculated Isaac.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp; What be the world comin&rsquo;
to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very maids won&rsquo;t get up,&rsquo; continued
Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;This was churning morning, and it was after
five before anybody moved.&nbsp; None of the men came near the
place until <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>six; the cows were left in the pasture, none of the
beasts were fed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shockin&rsquo;! shockin&rsquo;!&rsquo; commented the
farmer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear heart alive!&nbsp; I never heard
o&rsquo; sich doin&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I speak to them,&rsquo; cried Rosalie, her voice
rising with the recollection of her wrongs, &lsquo;they turn
round and tell me they are all too much upset to think of
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do they now?&rsquo; in tones of deep disgust.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a pretty story!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; And you know, Mr. Sharpe, &rsquo;t is the
last thing Elias would have wished&mdash;that the work should be
neglected and everything allowed to go wrong like this; yet they
seem to think me heartless for expecting things to go on as
before.&nbsp; And the worst of it all is&rsquo;&mdash;here poor
Rosalie began to weep hysterically&mdash;&lsquo;they don&rsquo;t
any of them believe that I am sorry for Elias, and they think
I&rsquo;m going to marry again; and, and&mdash;two hateful,
odious, impudent young men have already come to court
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her sobs well-nigh choked her as she made this last
announcement; and Isaac, full of concern, fell to patting her arm
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee now, my dear, don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;t is very annoyin&rsquo; for
&rsquo;ee, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; There, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee cry so.&nbsp; Well, well! to think on&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
Started coortin&rsquo; a&rsquo;ready, have they?&nbsp; Well, they
mid ha&rsquo; waited a bit!&nbsp; But come in a minute, do
&rsquo;ee, Mrs. Fiander, and sit &rsquo;ee down.&nbsp; Dear heart
alive! dear heart alive! poor Elias &rsquo;ud be terrible upset
if he were to see ye a-givin&rsquo; way like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He half persuaded, half propelled the still weeping widow
across the yard and into his kitchen, where, sitting down near
the table and covering her face with her hands under the heavy
crape veil, she continued to sob until her host was nearly
distracted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, my dear, take a sup o&rsquo; this, &rsquo;t will
do ye good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie threw back her veil and took the glass which he
offered her.&nbsp; Raising it to her lips, she found that the
dark decoction which it contained was excessively strong,
unusually acid, and unspeakably nasty.&nbsp; Fresh tears, not
prompted by sorrow this time, started to her eyes as she set down
the glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I am
better now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll finish it.&nbsp;
It seems very strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s that,&rsquo; agreed the farmer with some
pride.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sloe wine Bithey d&rsquo; call it; she do
make a quart every year.&nbsp; Wonderful good <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>for the
spasms, or sich-like.&nbsp; She do get taken that way sometimes
in her in&rsquo;ards, pore old soul! an&rsquo; she says a drop
o&rsquo; this do al&rsquo;ays set her to rights.&nbsp; Sloe wine!
ah, that&rsquo;s what it be called; ye&rsquo;d scarce think
&rsquo;twere made o&rsquo; nought but the snags what grows in the
hedges&mdash;jist snags an&rsquo; a trifle o&rsquo; sugar.&nbsp;
But I do assure ye &rsquo;t is that strong &rsquo;t will
sometimes lift the cork out o&rsquo; the bottle.&nbsp; Now, Mrs.
Fiander, ye&rsquo;d best finish it; &rsquo;t is a pity to let the
good stuff go to waste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, as Rosalie gratefully but firmly declined, the worthy man
appeased his thrifty conscience by draining the glass
himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well now, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he resumed, as he set it
down, &lsquo;I be trewly sorry that ye be so vexed an&rsquo;
ann&rsquo;yed wi&rsquo; the men comin&rsquo; so late; but, if I
may advise &rsquo;ee, be a bit stiff wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em;
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee let &rsquo;em fancy they can impose upon
&rsquo;ee because ye be a woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you, Mr. Sharpe, I showed them very plainly
that I was vexed this morning.&nbsp; I spoke as severely as I
could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, my dear, them chaps don&rsquo;t care for words;
more pertic&rsquo;lar a woman&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; Bless you!
they&rsquo;ve all got women-folks o&rsquo; their own, an&rsquo;
they be well used to scoldin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is different
wi&rsquo; us men; when we be angry <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>we can <i>dang</i> here and there,
and use a bit o&rsquo; language.&nbsp; Then, d&rsquo; ye
see,&rsquo; said Isaac, leaning forward confidentially,
&lsquo;the chaps understand as we be in earnest; but &rsquo;t
&rsquo;ud be no manner o&rsquo; good your tryin&rsquo; to do
that, my dear; &rsquo;t would n&rsquo;t come nat&rsquo;ral to
&rsquo;ee, and they would n&rsquo;t think a bit the better of
&rsquo;ee for it.&nbsp; Nay, nay,&rsquo; he repeated mournfully,
&lsquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t think the better of
&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A faint smile hovered round Rosalie&rsquo;s lips, but Isaac
remained quite serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman must show by her deeds that she be in
earnest,&rsquo; he went on after a pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T
is the only way, my dear.&nbsp; Deeds and not words for a
woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he paused again, shaking his head reflectively.&nbsp; It
was possible that his thoughts had travelled back to that
memorable box in which his erring father had enshrined the riven
locks that testified to his own transgressions and the vigorous
retaliation of his wife.&nbsp; Isaac&rsquo;s late mother had
certainly been a woman of action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, my dear,&rsquo; repeated Sharpe,
emerging from his reverie, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll be forced to turn
to deeds.&nbsp; Next time them chaps comes late, jist you up
an&rsquo; fine them.&nbsp; Says you, &ldquo;Short work desarves
short pay.&nbsp; Bear in mind,&rdquo; says <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>you,
&ldquo;that accordin&rsquo; to the work shall be the
wage.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I might try that,&rsquo; agreed Rosalie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But the worst of it is they lose so much time and do their
work so badly when they do come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, jist make a&rsquo; example o&rsquo; one o&rsquo;
them&mdash;that&rsquo;s your best plan.&nbsp; Give the worst
o&rsquo; them the sack, and ye&rsquo;ll find the others
&rsquo;ull settle down like&mdash;like lambs,&rsquo; said the
sheep-farmer, bringing out the simile triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much for your advice, Mr. Sharpe.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take it.&nbsp; And now&mdash;&rsquo; she paused a
moment, blushing&mdash;&lsquo;what would you recommend me to do
with regard to my other difficulty?&nbsp; How am I to make people
understand that I don&rsquo;t mean to marry again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, a body &rsquo;ud really think they need n&rsquo;t
be so pushin&rsquo;,&rsquo; remarked Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;It be
downright ondacent for &rsquo;em to be a-hangin&rsquo; about
&rsquo;ee so soon&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have no business to think of it at all, Mr.
Sharpe,&rsquo; interrupted the widow fiercely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall never, <i>never</i> put anyone in my dear Elias&rsquo;s
place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very well said, my dear,&rsquo; returned
Isaac, looking at her with real kindness and emotion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;T is the proper spirit.&nbsp; I myself, <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>as you may
have heard me say, was never one to set up for wedlock.&nbsp;
Well, ye&rsquo;ve had a husband, and a good &rsquo;un, an&rsquo;
you be in the right o&rsquo;t to be satisfied wi&rsquo; that,
just as I be satisfied wi&rsquo; havin&rsquo; no wife at
all.&nbsp; Dear heart alive! when I were a young chap the maids
did use to be castin&rsquo; their eyes at me, but I never took no
notice, and when I grew more staid there was one very
perseverin&rsquo; woman, I do mind&mdash;very perseverin&rsquo;
she were.&nbsp; Ah, she come to house here, time and again,
wi&rsquo; one excuse or another, and at last, so soon as I did
see her comin&rsquo; I did use to shut door in her
face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what I shall do,&rsquo; cried
Rosalie, laughing, and clapping her
hands&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s the very thing I shall do.&nbsp;
Thank you for the hint, Mr. Sharpe.&nbsp; That again, you see,
will be deeds, not words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac looked kindly at the bright face and sparkling eyes, and
nodded cheerfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That be the way to take &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only wish I had thought of it on Sunday,&rsquo; she
went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Those two men sat and talked so long, that
I was wishing them anywhere.&nbsp; I expected you on Sunday, Mr.
Sharpe,&rsquo; she added, in an altered voice, while the smile
vanished from her face.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&lsquo;Did &rsquo;ee?&rsquo; said Isaac, abashed, and
guilty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did, indeed&mdash;I thought you would have come
if only in memory of old times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to tell the trewth, I could n&rsquo;t a-bear to go
nigh the place,&rsquo; blurted out the farmer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay,
nay&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been a-goin&rsquo; to Littlecomb Farm Sunday
after Sunday for nigh upon five and twenty year.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how you could expect me, Mrs. Fiander, to go
there now as he be gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his smock-frock, and at
this tribute to Elias&rsquo;s memory his widow forgave the
gruffness of Isaac&rsquo;s tone, and almost, but not quite, the
slight to herself.</p>
<p>She gazed at him for a moment in silence with a quivering lip,
and he wiped his eyes again and heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not think of me at all,&rsquo; said Rosalie, at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t consider my loneliness, or
what I feel when I sit there, looking at the two empty chairs,
and thinking of how I used to sit between you, and how happy we
used to be.&nbsp; Is n&rsquo;t it worse for me to see his empty
place than you?&nbsp; You might have come&mdash;even if it did
hurt you&mdash;you might have come to bring me a word of
comfort.&nbsp; I think you were very unkind, Mr.
Sharpe!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee now, my dear,&rsquo;
stammered Isaac, almost purple in the face, and with his usually
keen eyes suffused with tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do really feel
touched to the &rsquo;eart when you look at me so pitiful and say
such things.&nbsp; God knows I&rsquo;d be main glad to comfort
you, but what can the likes of I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could let me feel that I had still a friend,&rsquo;
sobbed Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;You might come and sit in your old
chair, and we could&mdash;we could talk about Elias.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s trew, so we could,&rsquo; agreed Isaac in
a choked voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, next Sunday&mdash;if I live so
long&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not let nothing hinder me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
come, my dear.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I should ha&rsquo;
thought of you yesterday, but I could n&rsquo;t seem to think
o&rsquo; nothing but how &rsquo;Lias war n&rsquo;t
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall be very glad to see you,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, rising, and tremulously beginning to pull down her
veil.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I am very grateful for your
kindness.&nbsp; Perhaps,&rsquo; she added hesitatingly,
&lsquo;you might be able to look in one day during the
week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; returned the farmer, &lsquo;nay, Mrs.
Fiander, not before Sunday.&nbsp; I be very busy to-week&mdash;we
be shearin&rsquo;, d&rsquo; ye see, and there&rsquo;s the big
mead to be cut.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;not before Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&lsquo;Oh, very well,&rsquo; she responded a little
stiffly; and she went out of the house and across the yard
without speaking again except to say Good-bye at the gate.</p>
<p>The downs were now all bathed with the light of the sinking
sun, and the topmost branches of the hedges which bordered the
cornfields seemed turned to gold; while the banks beneath had
begun already to assume the deeper tint that spoke of gathering
dew&mdash;dew that the morning light would turn to a very sheet
of silver; but Rosalie could only see the beauties of the world
without through a mist of crape and tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not a friend in the world,&rsquo; she said to
herself, &lsquo;not one!&nbsp; Isaac would n&rsquo;t even take
the trouble to walk a quarter of a mile to see how I was getting
on after following his advice.&nbsp; He is only coming on Sunday
as a sort of duty, not because he wants to.&nbsp; Well, never
mind, I will show him and everyone that I can look after
myself.&nbsp; I want nobody&rsquo;s pretended pity since nobody
really cares.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she held up her head beneath its heavy veil, and went on
her way with a stately carriage and a firm step.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next morning when the men
came slowly sauntering to their work they were surprised to see
Mrs. Fiander, clad this time not in homely print but in
ceremonious black, standing by her own door, with a severe
expression of countenance.&nbsp; She held a note-book in her
hand, and as each arrived she jotted down some memorandum
therein.&nbsp; When the last straggler had appeared upon the
scene, she summoned the entire band before her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men,&rsquo; she said, speaking calmly and very
distinctly, &lsquo;since you seem to pay no attention to what I
say, I must show you that I am not to be trifled with.&nbsp; I
shall fine every one of you this morning for being late.&nbsp; I
shall continue to fine you each morning that you are late, and I
shall deduct from your pay <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>a certain amount for every hour that
you wilfully waste.&nbsp; In fact, for the future your wage shall
be in exact proportion to the work you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men stared, gaped, and looked sullenly first at one
another and then at their mistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you understand?&rsquo; she inquired sharply.</p>
<p>Job Hunt, his red-bearded face even more glowing than usual,
answered in surly tones for himself and comrades.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, missus, us can&rsquo;t say as we do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll make it clear to you,&rsquo;
rang out the brisk young voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are paid for the
work you do during certain hours, and if you don&rsquo;t come
here punctually, or if you waste any of those hours, I shall
deduct from your weekly wage the value of the lost time&mdash;I
shan&rsquo;t pay you, in fact, for work you don&rsquo;t
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, now,&rsquo; responded Job, rolling his head from
side to side, and assuming a bullying air.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t hold wi&rsquo; these here reg&rsquo;lations.&nbsp; Us
don&rsquo;t want no new rules, do us, mates?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, that we don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; came the answer in a
chorus of growls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether you want them or not, I mean to keep to
them,&rsquo; returned Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;That will do; you can
all go to work now.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>She
turned, and went into the house; her heart was beating very fast,
and she was rather white about the lips, but she had borne
herself bravely, and no one would have guessed the difficulty she
had found in nerving herself to take this stand.</p>
<p>She could hear the men&rsquo;s voices murmuring together
discontentedly, but by-and-by the sound of heavy slouching steps
moving away in different directions warned her that the group had
dispersed.</p>
<p>It being the morning for cheese-making, she presently went
upstairs to change her imposing black robe for her working dress,
and, chancing as she came downstairs to look out of the window,
she observed that Job Hunt was standing, arms a-kimbo, by the
pigsties, in close conversation with his brother.&nbsp; Now, Job
should at that moment have been far on his way to the pasture;
Abel ought to have been feeding the pigs: this was palpable
defiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Deeds, not words,&rsquo; said Rosalie to herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They think I am merely threatening&mdash;I must show them
I am in earnest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went across the yard, note-book in hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is now half-past five,&rsquo; she remarked.&nbsp; <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>&lsquo;You,
Job, are two hours and a half late; you, Abel, an hour.&nbsp; I
have made a note of the time.&nbsp; Moreover, if I find that you
continue to disobey me I shall not keep you in my
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Job made an indescribable sound, between a snort and a groan,
and slowly walked away.&nbsp; Abel, however, continued to stare
darkly at his mistress, without changing his position.</p>
<p>As Rosalie, now thoroughly incensed, was about to pour out
upon him the vials of her wrath, she suddenly perceived&mdash;the
fact being unmistakably impressed upon her&mdash;that the
pigsties near which she stood were in a most disgraceful
condition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abel,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;when were these sties
cleaned out?&nbsp; Not, I am sure, on Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I were&mdash;mortal busy o&rsquo; Saturday,&rsquo;
returned Abel in sepulchral tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why were you more busy last Saturday than on any other
Saturday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abel shuffled from one foot to the other, and repeated sulkily
that he had been mortal busy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must clean them as soon as ever you have fed the
pigs,&rsquo; said Rosalie sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;t is
enough to bring fever to the place to have them in this
state.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&lsquo;Pigs is n&rsquo;t p&rsquo;ison,&rsquo; responded
Abel roughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not attempt to answer me back like that,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be very bad for the poor animals
themselves.&nbsp; Get to work without a moment&rsquo;s
delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saturday is the day,&rsquo; growled the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;blowed if I clean &rsquo;em out afore
Saturday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind what you are about,&rsquo; said his mistress
sternly, uplifting a warning fore-finger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not
put up with impertinence or disobedience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saturday is the day,&rsquo; shouted Abel; and the
shuffling movement became so violent and rapid that he actually
seemed to dance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This will never do,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
see I must make a change at once.&nbsp; Abel Hunt, I give you
notice to leave on Saturday week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One change be enough for me, Widow Fiander,&rsquo;
retorted Abel, uplifting his voice as though his mistress stood a
hundred yards away from him instead of barely two.</p>
<p>Rosalie&rsquo;s lips quivered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is your own fault,&rsquo; she cried
passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you behave in this way I must make
an example of you.&nbsp; Unless you do as I tell you, you must
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m danged if I do clean the pigs out <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>afore
Saturday,&rsquo; shrieked Abel; and he threw his hat upon the
ground, waved his arms, and stamped about like a maniac.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want no danged women-folk to come
a-orderin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me;&rsquo; and here Abel relieved his
feelings by what Isaac Sharpe would delicately call &lsquo;a bit
o&rsquo; language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clean your pigs yourself, Widow Fiander.&nbsp; One
change be enough for me!&nbsp; Notice me so much as ever ye like,
I&rsquo;ll not clean them pigs out afore Saturday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then came a little more &lsquo;language,&rsquo; and so on
<i>da capo</i>.</p>
<p>Never had such an experience fallen to Rosalie&rsquo;s lot
before; neither her kind old grandfather nor her doting husband
had ever given her a rough word; while they lived her
subordinates had invariably obeyed her orders with alacrity, and
treated her personally with respect.&nbsp; The sound of
Abel&rsquo;s strident tones, the sight of his inflamed face,
above all the words he used and the insolence of his manner,
positively frightened her.&nbsp; She turned pale,
trembled&mdash;then, making a valiant effort to stand her ground,
threw out her hand as though to command silence; but, as Abel
continued to dance and rave, sheer physical terror overcame her,
and she suddenly turned <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and fled, her heart thumping
violently against her ribs, the tears&mdash;never very far off
during these first days of her bereavement&mdash;springing to her
eyes.</p>
<p>She rushed upstairs to her room and flung herself across the
bed, burying her face in the pillow in an agony of
humiliation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a fool I am!&nbsp; What a miserable fool!&nbsp; To
be afraid of that wretched booby!&nbsp; How can I ever hope to
rule these people if I show the white feather at the
outset?&nbsp; Now, of course, they will think that they&rsquo;ve
only got to bully me and I shall at once give in.&nbsp; Oh, fool,
fool!&nbsp; To give way to silly womanish fears at such a
moment!&nbsp; Oh, oh! how shall I ever look them in the
face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She continued to roll her head on the pillow for some moments;
her cheeks had now become burning, and her heart still beat fast,
no longer with terror, but with anger.&nbsp; By-and-by she sat
up, pushed back her hair, and shook out the folds of her
dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all, &rsquo;t is never too late to mend,&rsquo;
she said to herself.</p>
<p>She went downstairs, and into the dairy, directing her maids
somewhat sharply, and setting about her own work with flushed
cheeks and a serious face.&nbsp; In course of time <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>her agitation
subsided, and after her solitary breakfast she was quite herself
again.</p>
<p>At noon, as she passed through the kitchen to the parlour, she
chanced to glance through the open door, and observed that the
men had gathered together in the yard, and were eagerly talking
instead of making their way homewards, or retiring to the barn to
eat their dinners.&nbsp; She feigned to pay no attention to them,
however, and walked on to her own quarters.</p>
<p>Presently she became aware that the whole body was advancing
towards the house, and a moment later Susan thrust in her round
face at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, mum, the men be wishin&rsquo; to speak a few
words with &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Rosalie, &lsquo;I will go out to
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the threshold of the outer door she paused,
looking round on the group, and waiting for them to take the
initiative.&nbsp; Job was, as before, the first to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be come to tell &rsquo;ee, Mrs. Fiander, as I wish to
notice ye for Saturday week.&nbsp; These here changes
bain&rsquo;t to my likin&rsquo;, and the mistress bain&rsquo;t to
my likin&rsquo;; so ye&rsquo;ll please to suit yourself by that
time, mum.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>He
spoke gruffly, and eyed her impertinently, but this time she did
not flinch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Job,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I have no doubt
I shall be able to do so without any difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abel was the next to advance, but Rosalie waved him aside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As it has already been settled that you are to
leave,&rsquo; she remarked, &lsquo;you can have nothing to say to
me.&nbsp; Step back.&nbsp; Now who comes next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James Bundy, it seemed, came next; he approached a little
hesitatingly, looking hard at his mistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, mum, I wish to leave on Saturday
week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right,&rsquo; returned Rosalie with great
unconcern.&nbsp; &lsquo;Next!&rsquo;</p>
<p>James Bundy stepped back and Robert Cross stepped forward,
smiling obsequiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure, mum, it do go agen me terrible to make
sich a break as this here, but still, d&rsquo; ye see, we
can&rsquo;t nohow put up with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not take the trouble to explain&mdash;you wish
to leave on Saturday week with the others, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees&mdash;leastways&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
Sam Belbin, you wish to leave too?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Sam
Belbin made a step forward and glanced round appealingly.</p>
<p>By this time his companions were looking very blank.&nbsp; The
sudden assault by which they had expected to frighten their
mistress into capitulation had apparently failed.&nbsp; Their
respective attitudes had changed; she was calm and unmoved, and
they were beginning to be seriously uneasy.&nbsp; Good places and
regular pay were not to be picked up every day in that part of
the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Sam?&rsquo; said Rosalie kindly, as though to
help him out.</p>
<p>Sam was the chief of the three &lsquo;dairy chaps,&rsquo; a
good-looking young fellow of about four-and-twenty, with a dark,
good-humoured countenance and a certain jaunty air.&nbsp; As he
now advanced a smile flashed suddenly over his face, his white
teeth gleaming out pleasantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mum,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mum&mdash;Mrs.
Fiander&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Sam, what have <i>you</i> got to say?&nbsp; The
usual thing, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, mum&mdash;not at all, mum.&nbsp; I&mdash;wish to
say as I haven&rsquo;t got no fault to find at all, mum.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll come in better time to-morrow morn, an&rsquo;
ye&rsquo;ll not have to speak to me agen, mum.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&lsquo;<i>Very</i> good!&rsquo; said Rosalie in a
different tone.&nbsp; At this unexpected speech a lump came in
her throat, but she choked it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have the others got anything to say?&rsquo; she
inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because, if so, I hope they will make
haste and say it.&nbsp; My dinner will be getting
cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men who had not hitherto spoken looked at each other
uncertainly, their glances finally resting on the beaming
countenance of Sam Belbin.&nbsp; After all, had he not chosen the
better part?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do agree with he,&rsquo; said one under his breath,
and then another.&nbsp; By-and-by all remarked aloud, somewhat
falteringly, that they just thought they would mention their wish
to give more satisfaction in the future.</p>
<p>Job and his followers scowled at these renegades, but their
mistress rewarded them with a gracious smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well said,&rsquo; she remarked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the proper spirit.&nbsp; Do your duty by me,
and you will find me ready to do mine by you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The day was hers, as she felt when she returned in triumph to
her dinner.</p>
<p>Isaac Sharpe happened to be strolling through the village that
evening, when he was accosted by Mrs. Belbin, who was <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>standing, as
was her custom at this hour, arms a-kimbo, on her doorstep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There be a great upset up at Fiander&rsquo;s,
bain&rsquo;t there, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac brought his slow, ruminative gaze to bear on her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what upset do ye mean, Mrs. Belbin?&nbsp; Things
be like to be upset now that the master&rsquo;s gone to the New
House.&nbsp; But I hope as your son an&rsquo; the rest of
&rsquo;em be giving the widow so little trouble as ever they
can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dunno about that, sir.&nbsp; My Sam he do tell I as
there was a regular blow-up this mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low as my son <i>he</i> did behave so well as ever he
could.&nbsp; Says he to Mrs. Fiander, &ldquo;Mum,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t no fault to find wi&rsquo; you at all;
and I&rsquo;ll do my <i>h</i>endeavours to gi&rsquo;e ye
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; That were what <i>he</i> did
say&mdash;my son Sam did; but there was others as,
accordin&rsquo; to all accounts, went on most
scandalious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Belbin rolled up her eyes and wagged her head
significantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Paddock, hastening to cross the
road and join in the conversation, &lsquo;it did give me sich a
turn when I heard on it, that I did sit down on the table.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T were a good job as I did, else I should ha&rsquo; fell
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>down.&nbsp; Sich doin&rsquo;s!&nbsp; The whole lot of
&rsquo;em&mdash;aye, every single one as works for
her&mdash;marchin&rsquo; up to give her notice!&nbsp; &rsquo;T
was enough to frighten a pore lone woman out of her
wits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have n&rsquo;t heard a word of this,&rsquo; cried
Isaac emphatically.&nbsp; &lsquo;The men gave her notice,
d&rsquo; ye say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All except my Sam,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Belbin
proudly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, they all did go up in a lump,
so to speak, and noticed her, one arter the other, till it come
to my Sam&rsquo;s turn, an&rsquo; then he up an&rsquo; says,
&ldquo;Mrs. Fiander, mum,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t
got no fault to find wi&rsquo; ye;&rdquo; and a few more, when
they heard that, heartened theirselves up and follered his
example.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T was very well done o&rsquo; your Sam,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Paddock in a complimentary tone; &lsquo;but as for them
others&mdash;why, they do say as Abel Hunt were a-dancin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; a-swearin&rsquo; like a madman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want no
orderin&rsquo; from danged women-folk,&rdquo; says he, just so
bold as if the missus was his wife.&nbsp; And Job, he did shout
at her so rough, and speak so impident!&nbsp; &rsquo;T was really
shockin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go up and see her,&rsquo; said Sharpe, much
perturbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know
whatever&rsquo;s come to folks these times.&nbsp; As to <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>them
Hunts&mdash;I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e them a bit o&rsquo; my
mind.&nbsp; They should be ashamed o&rsquo; theirselves to treat
a pore young creature so disrespectful.&nbsp; They do think, I
s&rsquo;ppose, as Mrs. Fiander has n&rsquo;t got nobody to
purtect her, and they can serve her so bad as they like.&nbsp;
But them as was friends to her husband is friends to her.&nbsp;
Pore young thing!&nbsp; Well, I be glad your son did do his duty
by her, anyways, Mrs. Belbin.&nbsp; My Father A&rsquo;mighty,
these be times!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked away at an accelerated pace, the women looking after
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did speak so feelin&rsquo;, did n&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;
commented Mrs. Paddock.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Pore young
creature!&rdquo; says he, d&rsquo; ye mind?&nbsp; An&rsquo;
&ldquo;Pore young thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Master be a very
feelin&rsquo; man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; agreed Mrs. Belbin; &lsquo;an&rsquo; he did
say as he were glad my Sam did do his duty.&nbsp; Ah, he be a
good man, master be!&nbsp; But I would n&rsquo;t like so very
much to be Abel Hunt jist now&mdash;nay, nor Job
neither.&rsquo;</p>

97</span>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<blockquote><p>Souvent femme varie,<br />
Bien fol est qui s&rsquo;y fie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mistress of Littlecomb Farm had
no cause to complain of the unpunctuality of any of her
workpeople on the following morning.&nbsp; Each man appeared at
the very moment he was supposed to appear, the maids were up
betimes, and the business of the day progressed with far greater
speed than usual.</p>
<p>At dinner-time she again observed a group of men in the yard,
smaller in number, however, than on the preceding day, and
talking with dismal countenances and hesitating tones.&nbsp;
Susan came presently to announce, as before, that some of the men
wished to speak to her.</p>
<p>Rosalie went out, and discovered a detachment of four awaiting
her, two with plaintive, wobegone faces, the others in a state of
surly depression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Missus,&rsquo; stammered James Bundy, &lsquo;we be
a-come&mdash;me and these here chaps&mdash;be <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>a-come to
&rsquo;pologise, and to say as we hopes ye won&rsquo;t bear no
malice, and as ye&rsquo;ll overlook what has passed.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll undertake to give satisfaction from this time
for&rsquo;ard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is a pity you did not say that yesterday,
James,&rsquo; said Rosalie severely.</p>
<p>Bundy looked at Cross, and the latter&rsquo;s jaw fell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ye&rsquo;d please to overlook it, mum,&rsquo;
resumed James, falteringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We was, so to speak,
took by surprise wi&rsquo; the new rules, and we was
persuaded&rsquo;&mdash;here he darted a reproachful glance at
Joe&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a long family, mum,&rsquo; he
added tearfully, &lsquo;and my wife&mdash;she be near her time
wi&rsquo; the eleventh&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, James, you have been foolish, but I do not
altogether think it was your fault.&nbsp; I will make no definite
promise, but I will see how you go on between this and Saturday
week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be to go on Saturday week?&rsquo; ejaculated James,
whose wits were none of the keenest, and who was more impressed
by the severity of the tone than by Rosalie&rsquo;s actual
words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, you foolish fellow!&nbsp; Come, I will give you
another chance; but mind you behave very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Robert
Cross next came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine be a very long family, too,&rsquo; he began,
having evidently remarked the happy results which had ensued from
Bundy&rsquo;s plea.&nbsp; Rosalie stopped him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I will give you another chance, Cross,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Next time, think twice before you follow a bad
leader.&nbsp; As for you, Abel Hunt,&rsquo; she said, turning
sternly to that gentleman, &lsquo;I am at a loss to know what you
can have to say&mdash;in fact, I have no wish to hear it,
whatever it may be.&nbsp; You must go.&nbsp; No apology can atone
for your insolence yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how be you goin&rsquo; to manage about them
pigs?&rsquo; inquired Abel plaintively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is no concern of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sharpe was a-speakin&rsquo; to me yesterday,&rsquo;
put in Job, very humbly, for his courage was fast oozing away,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; he did say &rsquo;twould be terrible
ill-convenient for &rsquo;ee to have so many chaps
a-leavin&rsquo; together, an&rsquo; so me an&rsquo; my brother
agreed as we&rsquo;d ax to stop on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can do very well without you,&rsquo; retorted Mrs.
Fiander tartly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Job, you have behaved too
badly.&nbsp; You have been the ringleader of this disgraceful
business&mdash;you must certainly go.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&lsquo;On Saturday week?&rsquo; faltered Job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Saturday week&mdash;you <i>and</i> Abel.&nbsp; How
Abel can suppose I could possibly keep him after such conduct, I
can&rsquo;t imagine.&nbsp; I certainly will not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sharpe did say&rsquo;&mdash;Job was beginning, now
almost in tears, when she interrupted him relentlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind what Mr. Sharpe said.&nbsp; I have quite
made up my mind as to what I shall do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was thoroughly in earnest, and the men knew it.&nbsp; They
fell back ruefully, and their young mistress returned to the
house, carrying her head very high and setting her face
sternly.</p>
<p>When her work was over that afternoon she set out, with a
business-like air, on what seemed to be a tour of inspection;
first walking briskly along the rows of pigsties, the condition
of which had on the day before given rise to so much
controversy.&nbsp; All was now as it should be; Abel, Sam, and
one or two of the other subordinates having devoted their
attention to them at early dawn.&nbsp; Here were pigs of every
age and degree, from the venerable matron to the spry young
porker just beginning to devote himself to the serious business
of life&mdash;namely, growing fat.&nbsp; Seventy-two in all, and
most of them doomed <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>to destruction within a few months:
that was the part of the economy of farming which Rosalie most
disliked; it was the blot on the otherwise poetical and peaceful
avocation.&nbsp; But she had hitherto been taught to consider the
presence of these pigs an absolute necessity.&nbsp; Was this
really the case?&nbsp; Might not she, with her woman&rsquo;s wit,
devise some better expedient by means of which the obnoxious
animals could be dispensed with, and at the same time waste of
skim-milk and whey avoided?</p>
<p>Leaving the yard, she betook herself to the orchard, where a
few more porcine families were taking exercise.&nbsp; Their
presence somewhat detracted from the picturesque appearance of
the place, which, though the &lsquo;blooth&rsquo; or blossom had
long since fallen, had still a considerable share of beauty of
its own.&nbsp; The sunlight beating down now through the delicate
green leafage brought out wonderful silvery lights from the
lichened trunks, and outlined the curiously gnarled
branches.&nbsp; It struck out a golden path across the lush grass
for Rosalie to walk on, and she passed slowly down the glade with
bent head and serious face.</p>
<p>Turning when she reached the end to <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>retrace her
steps, she saw a well-known sturdy form approaching her, and
advanced to meet Isaac Sharpe, still with a certain queenly air,
and without quickening her pace.&nbsp; Isaac&rsquo;s countenance,
on the contrary, wore a perturbed and puzzled expression; his
brow was anxiously furrowed, and he gazed hard at Mrs. Fiander as
he hastened towards her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-feared ye&rsquo;ve had a deal o&rsquo;
trouble, here,&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I followed your advice, you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it did n&rsquo;t altogether answer?&rsquo; said the
farmer, with a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, it answered very well.&nbsp; I think the men
know I&rsquo;m in earnest now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Them two Hunts come round to my place at dinner-time;
they were in a taking, poor chaps!&nbsp; But &rsquo;twill do them
good.&nbsp; All the same, I think I&rsquo;d let &rsquo;em off, if
I was you, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; Job be a roughish sort o&rsquo;
chap, but he be a good cowman; an&rsquo; Abel, he be wonderful
with the management o&rsquo; pigs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let them off,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, her face hardening again as she thought of Abel&rsquo;s
maniacal dance, and of the loud voice which had frightened her,
and of Job&rsquo;s insolent manner when he had said, &lsquo;The
missus bain&rsquo;t to my likin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&lsquo;Well, but &rsquo;twill be a bit &rsquo;ard to
find as good,&rsquo; Isaac objected.&nbsp;
&lsquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps ye&rsquo;ll not better yourself.&nbsp;
I doubt &rsquo;t will be harder for you to get on wi&rsquo;
strange men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going to put strange men in their place.&nbsp;
I am not going to hire any more men; I&rsquo;m going to have
women.&nbsp; I can manage women very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear,&rsquo; cried Isaac, opening his eyes very
wide, and speaking in horror-stricken tones, &lsquo;women
can&rsquo;t do men&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but they can do women&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I have
thought it all out, Mr. Sharpe, and my mind is made up.&nbsp; Job
and Abel must go.&nbsp; I shall put Sam Belbin in Job&rsquo;s
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he have behaved well to &rsquo;ee,&rsquo;
conceded Isaac, unwillingly; &lsquo;but he be young.&nbsp; I
doubt if he&rsquo;s fit for &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve watched him,&rsquo; returned Rosalie,
positively, &lsquo;and I think he&rsquo;s quite fit for it.&nbsp;
He has worked under Job for some time, and is a capital
milker.&nbsp; I think he will manage very well.&nbsp; As to Abel,
I shall put no one in his place, for I mean to sell the
pigs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sell the pigs!&rsquo; ejaculated Isaac&mdash;&lsquo;at
this time o&rsquo; year?&rsquo;&nbsp; His face became absolutely
tragic, but Rosalie merely nodded.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; your
skim-milk,&rsquo; he gasped, &lsquo;an&rsquo; the whey, and
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There will be no skim-milk,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall make Blue Vinney cheese, as I used to make when I
was with my grandfather.&nbsp; Some people are very fond of
it.&nbsp; That is made entirely of skim-milk, you know.&nbsp; As
for the whey, there will not be much nourishment in it, but I
shall keep a few sows still, just to consume that and the
butter-milk.&nbsp; They will not require much attention as they
walk about here, you see, and there is always a lot of waste
green stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think ye&rsquo;ll find many folks here
what cares for the Blue Vinney cheese,&rsquo; said Isaac, still
much dejected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, &rsquo;t is all the
Ha&rsquo;-skim as they likes hereabouts.&nbsp; The Blue Vinney
has gone out o&rsquo; fashion, so to speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they don&rsquo;t buy them here I can send them to
Dorchester,&rsquo; said the widow resolutely.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
used to buy them up there faster than I could make them.&nbsp; So
you see there will be no waste, Mr. Sharpe; there will be less
work to do outside, and therefore I shall not miss Job or Abel;
but, as we shall be very busy in the dairy, I must have two or
three extra women to help me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Isaac
stared at her ruefully; she looked brighter than she had done
since her husband&rsquo;s death, but she also looked
determined.&nbsp; He shook his head slowly; his mind was of the
strictly conservative order, and the contemplated abolition of
pigs from the premises of this large dairy-farm seemed to him an
almost sacrilegious innovation.&nbsp; Moreover, to sell pigs in
July; to make cheeses that nobody in that part of the world cared
to eat; to replace two seasoned men who knew their
business&mdash;whatever might be their faults&mdash;with that
dangerous commodity, womankind&mdash;the whole experiment seemed
to him utterly wild, and pregnant with disaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to do it,&rsquo; said Rosalie, defying the
condemnation in his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;By this time next year you
will congratulate me on my success.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so, I am sure,&rsquo; said Isaac in a slightly
offended tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I came here to advise &rsquo;ee, but
it seems ye don&rsquo;t want no advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I do,&rsquo; she cried, softening in a
moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I value it of all things, Mr. Sharpe.&nbsp;
My one comfort in my difficulties is the thought that I can talk
them over with you.&nbsp; I have laid my plan before you quite
simply, in the hope that you would approve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said Isaac, somewhat <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>mollified,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t approve, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp; Since you
ask my advice, I&rsquo;ll tell ye plain that I don&rsquo;t think
the plan will work.&nbsp; Ye won&rsquo;t be able to sell your
pigs to begin with; then ye&rsquo;ll want a man wi&rsquo; more
experience than Sam to look after the cows; it bain&rsquo;t such
easy work&mdash;nay, that it bain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Then, as to
gettin&rsquo; more women &rsquo;bout the place, I don&rsquo;t
hold with the notion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it &rsquo;ud
benefit ye, my dear.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trewly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie appeared to meditate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think it over, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he urged;
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t do nothing in a hurry; that be my
advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ll think it
over.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come on Sunday, won&rsquo;t you, Mr.
Sharpe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; agreed Isaac doubtfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, I&rsquo;ll come on Sunday.&nbsp; I be main
glad you be thinking of taking my advice, Mrs.
Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am grateful to you for giving it,&rsquo; said Rosalie
with a sweet smile; and the farmer walked away, thinking that on
the whole women were far less unreasonable than he had hitherto
supposed.</p>
<p>The next day was Thursday&mdash;early closing day at
Branston&mdash;therefore no one was surprised when Mrs. Fiander,
having as she <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>averred some business to do in the town, ordered the
gig in the forenoon.&nbsp; It was the first time she had used
that vehicle since her husband&rsquo;s death, and she looked
sorrowful enough as she climbed into it, clad in her deepest
weeds.</p>
<p>The steady old horse looked round when she gathered up the
reins, as though wondering at the innovation&mdash;for Elias had
always been accustomed to drive&mdash;and was with some
difficulty induced to start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nigger be so wise as a Christian, that he be,&rsquo;
commented Bundy, as the gig and its occupant disappeared.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He was a-standin&rsquo; and a-waitin&rsquo; for master, so
sensible as I mid do myself.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;ll have to get
used to the change the same as the rest of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, an&rsquo; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;ll not like
it so very well,&rsquo; returned Abel sardonically.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Give a woman a whip in her hand, and she fancies
she&rsquo;s bound to lay it on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Nigger was suffered to jog along the road at his own pace,
for the old sadness which had fallen upon Rosalie had for a
moment checked her eager spirit, and a new preoccupation was,
moreover, now added to it.&nbsp; Would Elias approve of what she
was about to do, or would he agree with Isaac?&nbsp; <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>No, surely
he would say that she knew best; he was always pleased with
anything she did.&nbsp; He used to say that she was the best
manager he had ever known; and, on the other hand, used
frequently to speak of Isaac&rsquo;s &lsquo;notions&rsquo; with
good-humoured derision.&nbsp; It will be seen that Mrs.
Fiander&rsquo;s meditations over her friend&rsquo;s advice had
resulted, as indeed might have been expected, in the
determination to adhere to her original plan, and she was now on
her way to interview two personages whose co-operation would be
necessary in carrying it out.</p>
<p>Her appearance in the shop of Mr. Hardy, the principal grocer
of the town, caused a certain amount of commotion; everybody
turned to look at the beautiful young widow, who had indeed for
many days past formed the principal topic of conversation among
the townsfolk; and much interest was aroused by her murmured
request to see Mr. Hardy in private.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; Step this way,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; John, open the door there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John Hardy, a tall, good-looking young man in a white linen
jacket, hastened to obey his parent&rsquo;s behest, and was even
good enough to accompany the visitor along the passage <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>which led
from the shop to the family sitting-room.&nbsp; It was empty at
this hour, Mrs. Hardy being presumably occupied in household
duties; and Mr. John ushered Rosalie in with much ceremony, and
invited her to be seated in the best armchair.</p>
<p>Some disappointment was perceptible in his ingenuous
countenance when he found that the interview which had been so
mysteriously asked for was merely connected with cheese; but his
father listened to Rosalie&rsquo;s proposition with grave
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly see how the plan would
work,&rsquo; he remarked, shaking his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;We sell
your Ha&rsquo;skim cheeses very fairly well, Mrs.
Fiander.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hardy was a discreet person, and was
determined not to commit himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;But as for the
Blue Vinney, I&rsquo;d be very glad to oblige you, but I&rsquo;m
really afraid&mdash;you see there&rsquo;s scarcely any demand for
Blue Vinney nowadays.&nbsp; A few of the old folks ask for it now
and then, but we don&rsquo;t get, not to say, a reg&rsquo;lar
custom for &rsquo;t, and it would n&rsquo;t be worth our while to
keep it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am considered a particularly good hand at making Blue
Vinney,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I used to be quite
celebrated for it when I lived near Dorchester&mdash;in fact, I
could easily sell <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>my cheeses now at Dorchester, only I thought I would
give you the first offer as you have dealt with me so
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Growing warm in her excitement, she threw back her veil: John
Hardy, gazing at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, thought
Mrs. Fiander had never looked so handsome as in her widow&rsquo;s
weeds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dorchester!&rsquo; commented the senior.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That would be a long way for you to send,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure,&rsquo; put in the son quickly,
&lsquo;we&rsquo;d be sorry to think as Mrs. Fiander should need
to take her cheeses to Dorchester, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Hardy glanced from one to the other of the two
young faces, and, as Rosalie bestowed a grateful smile upon his
son, an idea seemed to strike him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said good-naturedly, &lsquo;you are
trying an experiment, I understand, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s always a certain amount o&rsquo; risk in an
experiment; but still, &ldquo;Nothing venture, nothing
have,&rdquo; they say.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re willing to venture I
shall be glad to help you all I can.&nbsp; Send your cheeses to
me, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to sell &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t promise to pay money down for &rsquo;em,&rsquo; he
added, cautiously, &lsquo;same as I do for the Ha&rsquo;skims,
but I&rsquo;ll try an&rsquo; sell &rsquo;em for you, and we can
settle about them after.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&lsquo;I am very much obliged,&rsquo; said Rosalie, a
little blankly, however, for she had not been accustomed to do
business in this manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will use our utmost endeavours to push the
goods&mdash;of that you may be sure,&rsquo; cried young John
eagerly; and she smiled upon him again, so graciously that he
somewhat lost his head, and made several incoherent statements as
to the excellence of Blue Vinney cheese for which his worthy
father subsequently brought him to book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to get round a woman, my
lad,&rsquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. F. will just think you
be right down silly; the notion o&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; her as
Blue Vinney cheese was richer to the palate than
Rammil&mdash;why, Rammil&rsquo;s made altogether o&rsquo; good
new milk, and this here&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but skim.&nbsp; She
makes cheese o&rsquo; skim instead o&rsquo; givin&rsquo; it to
the pigs, and you go and tell her all that rubbish.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s no fool&mdash;the widow is n&rsquo;t&mdash;that is
n&rsquo;t the way to make up to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rosalie had driven across the market-place and up a
side street to the house of a certain auctioneer, and to her
great joy found him at home.</p>
<p>He was a stout middle-aged man, with some pretensions to good
looks, and more to being <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>a dandy.&nbsp; He was attired in a
sporting costume of quite correct cut, and received his visitor
with an air of jovial hospitality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delighted to see you, I&rsquo;m sure, Mrs.
Fiander.&nbsp; I feel <i>h</i>onoured.&nbsp; I am at your service
for anything you may wish&mdash;you may command me,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie had begun by expressing a desire to transact a little
business with him, and now proceeded to explain its nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to sell my pigs by auction,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have about sixty-five to dispose of, and I
should like the sale to take place as early as possible next
week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next week!&rsquo; ejaculated the auctioneer, his face
falling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rosalie, with great decision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;have you considered the question?&nbsp; It
would be difficult to sell off such a number of pigs at any
season of the year, but now&mdash;in the height of the
summer!&nbsp; If I may advise you, Mrs. Fiander, don&rsquo;t be
in such a hurry.&nbsp; Wait and sell the pigs at a more
convenient time.&nbsp; Nobody&rsquo;s killing pigs now, and most
people as go in for fatting pigs have got as many as they want by
this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be next week,&rsquo; said the widow
obstinately.&nbsp; Job and Abel were leaving on the <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Saturday,
and the stock must be got rid of before the new era began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll lose to a certainty, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said Mr. Wilson, running his hand through his well-oiled
hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;What with all the regulations on account of
the swine fever, the selling of such a number of pigs would be a
difficult matter&mdash;at any season, as I say, and you
don&rsquo;t give me no time scarcely to get out my
bills&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sale must take place before Saturday week,&rsquo;
insisted Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must do the best you can for
me, Mr. Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may rely on that, Mrs. Fiander; but it really
grieves me to think that you should lose so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, thoughtfully biting the end of one finger, and
suffering his eyes meanwhile to travel slowly over the handsome
face and graceful figure of his client.&nbsp; During this
scrutiny he was not unobservant of the rich materials of which
her dress was composed, and her general appearance of mournful
prosperity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s against my own interest, but I
always like to oblige a lady&mdash;particularly such a lady as
you, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drive round the country and
see if I can persuade people <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>to buy up those pigs by private
contract.&nbsp; I know a pig-jobber over Shaftesbury side as
might be glad to take a good many off you, if he got them at a
low price.&nbsp; If I understand you, Mrs. Fiander, the price is
not an object to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;o,&rsquo; faltered Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course, I should like as much money as possible for them, but the
price is not so important as to get rid of the animals as soon as
possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; agreed the auctioneer cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Fiander, I shall lose by it, as I say, but I
will try and arrange matters for you in this way.&nbsp; Under the
circumstances, ma&rsquo;am, I grudge no time or trouble spent in
your service.&nbsp; I am always thought to be a lady&rsquo;s
man&mdash;my late poor wife used to say that my consideration for
ladies injured the business; but, as I used to tell her, a man
has a heart or else he has n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; <i>If</i> he has a
heart&mdash;if he has more feelings than his neighbours, he is
n&rsquo;t to blame for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the business go, my
dear,&rdquo; I &rsquo;d say, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t ask me to be
hard on a woman.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had been whispered among the gossips of Branston that
during the lifetime of the late Mrs. Wilson her lord had been
wont to correct her occasionally with a boot-jack, but <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>these
rumours had not reached Rosalie&rsquo;s ears; and even if they
had she would probably have disbelieved them.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
she did not quite like the manner in which the gallant auctioneer
leered at her, nor his unnecessarily warm pressure of her hand on
saying good-bye.</p>
<p>She drove homewards with a mixture of feelings.&nbsp; The
inauguration of her new plan seemed to involve a considerable
amount of risk, not to say loss; she felt conscious of the fact
that she owed her very partial success more to the persuasion of
her beauty than to faith in her prospects as a woman of business;
yet there was, after all, satisfaction in thinking that she had
carried her point.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with some trepidation that
Rosalie awaited Isaac&rsquo;s visit on the Sunday following that
long and eventful week.&nbsp; The good fellow was, indeed, so
overcome when he found himself seated once more in the familiar
chair, with the vacant place opposite to him, that she had not
courage to make a confession which would, she knew, distress and
annoy him&mdash;a confession which would have to be made,
nevertheless.</p>
<p>Her own eyes filled as she saw Isaac unaffectedly wiping away
his tears with his great red-and-yellow handkerchief, and for
some moments no word was spoken between them.&nbsp; She filled
his pipe and lit it for him, but he <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>suffered it to rest idly between his
fingers, and made no attempt to sip at the tumbler of spirits and
water which she placed at his elbow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of him,&rsquo; she murmured softly, at
last, bending forward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me about when you knew
him first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard!&rsquo; said Sharpe with a sniff, &lsquo;I
know&rsquo;d him all his life, I may say; I were with him when he
were confirmed&mdash;and I were at both his weddin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Yours was the only one I was n&rsquo;t at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie straightened herself, feeling as if a douche of cold
water had been unexpectedly applied to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; went on Isaac, shaking his head mournfully,
&lsquo;I knowed his fust and his second missus well&mdash;they
was nice women, both on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; The fust was a bit near,
but, as poor &rsquo;Lias used to say, &rsquo;twas a good
fault.&nbsp; Ah, he&rsquo;d say that&mdash;a good
fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his pipe between his lips, and immediately took it out
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The second Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;was
a good creatur&rsquo; too&mdash;very savin&rsquo;; delicate,
though; but he&rsquo;d al&rsquo;ays make allowances, her husband
would, though it did seem to me sometimes as it was a bit
disheartenin&rsquo; to a man when his wife got the &rsquo;titus
just at the <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>busiest time of year.&nbsp; Ah, he used to tell me
often as it were n&rsquo;t no use to be a dairy-farmer without
you had a active wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie fidgeted in her chair: these little anecdotes of Isaac
seemed to her rather pointless under the present
circumstances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All I can say is,&rsquo; she remarked after a pause,
&lsquo;that <i>I</i> always found poor dear Elias the most
considerate of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low ye did,&rsquo; said Isaac,
turning his moist eyes upon her.&nbsp; &lsquo;He thought a deal
o&rsquo; you&mdash;he did that.&nbsp; Says he to me the first
night I come here, when you come home arter getting wed, &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the best
o&rsquo; the three.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was comfort in this thought, and Rosalie looked
gratefully at her visitor, whose eyes had again become suffused
with tears as he recalled this touching tribute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He used to say,&rsquo; she observed presently in a low
voice, &lsquo;that I was a very good manager, but I don&rsquo;t
think it was on that account alone he was so fond of
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, he did use to say you was a wonderful
manager,&rsquo; said Isaac, disregarding the latter part of the
sentence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many a time he&rsquo;ve a-told me that you
had n&rsquo;t got no equal as a manager.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sentiment was evidently not to be the order <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>of the day,
but here, at least, was an opportunity of introducing the little
matter of business which weighed so heavily on Rosalie&rsquo;s
conscience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she said, diffidently, &lsquo;he would
say I was wise in carrying out this new plan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What new plan?&rsquo; inquired Isaac, pausing with his
handkerchief halfway to his eyes, and turning towards her
sternly, though the tears hung upon his grizzled lashes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the one I spoke to you of&mdash;about doing away
with the pigs, you know,&rsquo; she returned faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That there notion that I gi&rsquo;e ye my advice
agen?&rsquo; said Sharpe grimly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; hesitatingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought it
over, as you told me to, and I did n&rsquo;t think I could manage
differently.&nbsp; I find I can sell the pigs all right, and Mr.
Hardy has promised to try and dispose of my Blue Vinney
cheeses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac blew his nose, returned his handkerchief to his pocket,
and stood up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear as ye can manage so well,&rsquo;
he said sarcastically.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want no
advice, that&rsquo;s plain; and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t never offer
you none agen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wish ye good day, Mrs.
Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go away like that,&rsquo; cried she <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>piteously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t be offended
with me.&nbsp; Such an old friend&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a figure passed across the window, and a loud
knock was heard at the house-door.&nbsp; Rosalie rushed to the
door of the parlour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let any one in, Susan,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m engaged.&nbsp;
Stay at least a minute, Mr. Sharpe&mdash;I want to tell
you&mdash;I want to explain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Throwing out one hand in pleading, she held open the parlour
door an inch or two with the other, and presently the manly tones
of Mr. Cross were heard through the chink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear that Mrs. Fiander is engaged.&nbsp;
Will you kindly inform her that I will call next
Sunday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him, Susan,&rsquo; said her mistress, opening the
door a little way, and speaking under her
breath&mdash;&lsquo;tell him that I am always engaged on
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Susan was heard to impart this information, and then the
visitor&rsquo;s tones were heard again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a pity!&nbsp; Tell her, if you please,
that I shall &rsquo;ope to have the pleasure of finding her at
home some afternoon during the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;I am always out in the afternoon,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, speaking this time so decidedly that it was not
necessary for Susan to repeat her words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the young man, addressing this time not
the maid but the bright eye of which he caught a glimpse through
the door, &lsquo;then I shall take my chance of finding you in
the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am too busy to see anyone in the morning,&rsquo;
retorted Rosalie; and she shut the door with a finality which
left Mr. Cross no option but to depart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see I do take your advice sometimes,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, turning to Isaac, and speaking in a plaintive tone,
though a little smile played about her mouth.</p>
<p>Isaac&rsquo;s back was towards her, and he made no reply; as
she approached the burly form, however, she saw his shoulders
heave, and presently, to her great relief, discovered that he was
shaking with silent laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, ye don&rsquo;t do things by
halves&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say that for &rsquo;ee,&rsquo; he
chuckled.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a-got rid o&rsquo; that there chap,
anyhow.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not ax to come coortin&rsquo;
again.&nbsp; Well, well, if ye manage as well in other ways
I&rsquo;ll not say that ye bain&rsquo;t fit to look arter
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&lsquo;But it was your advice, you know, Mr.
Sharpe,&rsquo; she said demurely.&nbsp; &lsquo;You gave me the
hint about shutting the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I did,&rsquo; said Isaac; and,
being a good-natured and placable person, his transitory sense of
resentment was soon replaced by thorough appreciation of the
humorous side of the situation.</p>
<p>The discomfiture of Samuel Cross gave a salutary lesson not
only to himself, but to sundry other adventurous young men who
had been a little hasty in their overtures to Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp;
It was soon noised abroad that the young widow wished for the
present to keep herself to herself, as the saying went, and that
it would in consequence be advisable to abstain from making
advances to her&mdash;at least, until she had laid aside her
crape.</p>
<p>For some months, therefore, Rosalie enjoyed comparative
immunity from the importunities which had so much annoyed her,
while the new arrangements appeared to work amazingly well both
within and without Littlecomb Farm.</p>
<p>Job and Abel departed in due course; the pigs were
sold&mdash;at considerable loss to their owner; Sam was installed
as chief cowman, and sustained his honours cheerfully, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>without,
however, appearing to be unduly elated; and three strapping
damsels were engaged as dairy-maids.&nbsp; With their
co-operation Mrs. Fiander turned out weekly a score and more of
large round cheeses, which were stowed away in an upper room
until, in course of time, they should become sufficiently
ripe&mdash;some people might use the term mouldy&mdash;to have
earned their title of &lsquo;Blue Vinney&rsquo; cheese.</p>
<p>This process took a considerable time, and meanwhile the
profits of the dairy were a good deal lessened since Rosalie had
left off making the Ha&rsquo;skim cheeses, for which she had been
so particularly famed, and for which she had invariably received
regular payment.&nbsp; Still, as she told herself, when the Blue
Vinneys were disposed of, she would receive her money in a lump
sum, and all would be the same in the end.</p>
<p>Her chief trouble at this time arose from the frequent calls
of Mr. Wilson, the auctioneer, who, though he could not be said
to be regularly paying attention to Rosalie, found, nevertheless,
sundry excuses for &lsquo;dropping in&rsquo; and conversing with
her at all manner of unseasonable times.&nbsp; He made, as has
been implied, no direct advances; and Rosalie, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>moreover,
could not treat him so unceremoniously as she had treated Mr.
Cross, for she felt in a manner indebted to him about the sale of
those unlucky pigs.&nbsp; He had carried the matter through for
her with great difficulty to himself, as he frequently assured
her, and he had steadily refused all remuneration.&nbsp; It was
hard, therefore, for the young widow to repel or avoid him, and
she was in consequence reluctantly obliged to endure many hours
of his society.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> September day Rosalie betook
herself to the little churchyard where Elias lay at rest.&nbsp;
Three months had elapsed since he had been taken from her, and
she had not let a week pass without visiting and decorating his
grave.&nbsp; She thought of him often, and her affectionate
regret was in no way diminished; yet, though she was now on her
way to perform this somewhat melancholy duty, she advanced with a
bright face and a rapid bounding step.</p>
<p>She was young, full of vigour and elasticity, and on such a
day as this&mdash;an exquisite golden day, full of sunshine, and
yet with a tartness hinting of approaching autumn in the
air&mdash;every fibre of her being thrilled with the very joy of
life.</p>
<p>When she knelt by her husband&rsquo;s grave, however, her face
became pensive and her <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>movements slow.&nbsp; Taking a pair
of garden shears from the basket which she carried, she clipped
the short grass closer still, laid the flowers gently down on the
smooth surface, placed the dead ones in her basket, and, after
lingering a moment, bent forward and kissed the new white
headstone.</p>
<p>As she rose and turned to go away, her face still shadowed by
tender regret, she suddenly perceived that she was not
alone.&nbsp; At a little distance from her, ensconced within the
angle of the churchyard wall, a man was sitting, with an easel in
front of him.&nbsp; Above the large board on the easel she caught
sight of a brown velveteen coat and a flannel shirt loosely
fastened with a brilliant tie; also of a dark face framed in
rather long black hair and shaded by a soft felt hat of peculiar
shape.&nbsp; From beneath its tilted brim, however, a pair of
keen dark eyes were gazing with intense curiosity at the young
woman, and, though he held a palette in one hand and a brush in
the other, he was evidently more interested in her than in his
painting.</p>
<p>Rosalie, vexed that her recent display of feeling had been
observed by this stranger, walked quickly down the little path,
colouring high with displeasure the while, and assuming <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>that
stately carriage which came naturally to her in such
emergencies.</p>
<p>The gentleman turned slowly on his camp-stool, his eyes
twinkling and his dark moustache twitching, and watched her till
she was out of sight.</p>
<p>Rosalie was clad in her morning print, and wore her
wide-brimmed chip hat, so that her attire gave no indication of
her station in life.&nbsp; As her tall figure disappeared the man
rose, stepped past his easel&mdash;which supported a canvas
whereon already appeared in bold firm lines a sketch of the
antiquated church porch&mdash;and made his way up the path and
across the grass to Elias Fiander&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us see,&rsquo; he murmured; &lsquo;that kiss spoke
volumes.&nbsp; It must be a sweetheart at the very least; yet
when she came swinging down the meadow-path she certainly looked
heart-whole.&nbsp; Here we are&mdash;a brand-new stone.&nbsp;
Funny name&mdash;Elias Fiander!&nbsp; No&mdash;aged
sixty-two.&nbsp; Must have been her father, or perhaps her
grandfather&mdash;the girl looked young enough&mdash;so all my
pretty romance has come to nothing.&nbsp; I wish she had stayed a
few minutes longer&mdash;I would give something to make a sketch
of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went back to his work whistling, and <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>thinking
over Rosalie&rsquo;s beautiful face and figure regretfully, and
with an admiration that was entirely &aelig;sthetic, for he had a
cheery, rotund little wife at home in London, and half a dozen
children to provide for, so that he was not given to
sentiment.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, because his admiration was so innocent and
his ambition so laudable, that a few days later his wish to
transfer Rosalie&rsquo;s charms to canvas was granted in a most
unexpected way.</p>
<p>It had been unusually hot, and the artist, having finished his
sketch of the porch, was proceeding by a short cut through
Littlecomb Farm to the downs beyond, in search of cooler air,
when, on crossing a cornfield at the further end of which the
reapers were busily at work, he suddenly came upon a
woman&rsquo;s figure lying in the shade of a &lsquo;shock&rsquo;
of sheaves.</p>
<p>The first glance announced her identity; the second assured
him that she was fast asleep.&nbsp; She had removed her hat, and
her clasped hands supported her head, the upward curve of the
beautiful arms being absolutely fascinating to the artist&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; The oval face with its warm colouring, the slightly
loosened masses of dark hair, were thrown <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>into strong
relief by the golden background; the absolute abandonment of the
whole form was so perfect in its grace that he paused, trembling
with artistic delight, and hardly daring to breathe lest he
should disturb her.</p>
<p>But Rosalie, overcome with the heat and tired out after a hard
morning&rsquo;s work, slept peacefully on while he swung his
satchel round, opened it quickly, and began with swift deft
fingers to make a rapid sketch of her.&nbsp; A few light pencil
strokes suggested the exquisite lines of the prostrate form, and
he had already begun to dash on the colour, when, with a loud
shriek and flapping of wings, a blackbird flew out of the
neighbouring hedge, and Rosalie stirred and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Rosalie&rsquo;s eyes always took people by surprise, and the
artist, who had not before noticed their colour, suffered his to
rest upon them appreciatively while they were still hazy with
sleep; but when, with returning consciousness, he observed a
sudden wonder and indignation leap into them, he threw out his
hand hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One moment, if you please&mdash;stay just as you are
for one moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still under the influence of her recent heavy slumber, and
taken aback by the peremptory tone, Rosalie obeyed.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; she inquired
suspiciously, but without changing her posture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am making a picture of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A warm tide of colour spread over the upturned face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should n&rsquo;t do that without asking my
leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man must take his chances where he finds them,&rsquo;
said the artist.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t often get such a
chance as this.&nbsp; I am a poor man, and can&rsquo;t afford to
let an opportunity slip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had a shrewd sallow face and kind merry eyes, and as he
spoke he paused in his work and smiled down at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be disobliging,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, &lsquo;but I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I fell
asleep by accident&mdash;I should n&rsquo;t have thrown myself
down like this if I had thought anyone was likely to see
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the better,&rsquo; commented he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
could n&rsquo;t have put yourself into such a position if you had
tried to.&nbsp; It has evidently come naturally, and it is simply
perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused to squeeze out a little colour from one of the tiny
tubes in his open box, and again smiled encouragingly down at his
model.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&lsquo;Now will you oblige me by closing your eyes
again?&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t screw them up like that; let the
lids drop gently&mdash;so, very good.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a pity to
hide the eyes&mdash;one does not often see blue eyes with such
Murillo colouring; but the length of the lashes makes amends, and
I want you asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again a wave of colour swept over Rosalie&rsquo;s face: the
stranger marked it approvingly, and worked on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it nearly done?&rsquo; she inquired presently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You said you would only be a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find it will take several moments, but I am sure you
would not grudge me the time if you knew what a wonderful piece
of good fortune this is for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can it be good fortune for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t frown, please; let the lids lie
loosely.&nbsp; I will tell you why I consider this meeting a
piece of good fortune.&nbsp; Do you know what it is to make
bread-and-butter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I make butter three times a week,&rsquo; returned
Rosalie, somewhat amused; &lsquo;and I make bread too,
sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have got to make bread-and-butter every day of
my life, not only for myself, but for my wife and six small
children, and I have nothing to make it with but this.&nbsp; You
may <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>open
your eyes for a moment if you don&rsquo;t move
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie opened her eyes, and saw that he was bending towards
her, and holding out a paint-brush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, go to sleep again,&rsquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I make my bread-and-butter with;
and it is n&rsquo;t always an easy task, because there are a
great many other chaps who want to make bread-and-butter in the
same kind of way, and we can never be quite sure which among the
lot of us will find the best market for his wares.&nbsp; But I
shall have no difficulty in disposing of you, I am
certain&mdash;therefore, I consider myself in luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that you will sell that little picture of
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not this one, but a big one which I shall make from
it.&nbsp; It will go to an exhibition, and people will come and
look at it.&nbsp; As the subject is quite new and very pretty, I
shall ask a big price for it, and there will be lots of
bread-and-butter for a long time to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But would anybody care to buy a picture of a woman whom
they don&rsquo;t know, lying asleep in a cornfield?&rsquo; cried
Rosalie incredulously, and involuntarily raising her drooped
lids.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most certainly they will,&rsquo; responded the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>artist
confidently.&nbsp; &lsquo;This will be a lovely thing when it is
done.&nbsp; I shall come here to-morrow and make a careful study
of this stook against which you are lying, and of the field; and
I shall look about for a few good types of harvesters to put in
the middle distance.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was speaking more to himself
than to her, but Rosalie listened with deep interest, and watched
him sharply through her half-closed lids.&nbsp; Suddenly she saw
him laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps if I come across a very attractive specimen of
a rustic, I may place him just behind the stook here, peering
through the sheaves at you, or bending forward as if he were
going to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Rosalie, starting
violently and opening her eyes wide.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t have it, I won&rsquo;t be in the picture at all if
you put anything of that kind in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not&mdash;if I chose a particularly nice young
man?&rsquo; inquired the painter, still laughing softly to
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not if I chose&mdash;<i>the</i> young
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo;
protested she, her cheeks crimson again and her lips
quivering.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no young man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to tell me, my dear child, that with that
face you have lived till now <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>without anyone courting you&mdash;as
I suppose they would call it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course they court me,&rsquo; Rosalie hastened to
admit; &lsquo;but I hate them all.&nbsp; And they are all very
ugly,&rsquo; she added eagerly, &lsquo;and would look dreadful in
a picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, you are frowning again.&nbsp; Come, let us talk
of something less exciting.&nbsp; Keep still, please.&nbsp; So
you make butter three times a week, do you?&nbsp; You are a
farmer&rsquo;s daughter, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was a farmer&rsquo;s granddaughter,&rsquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;My father was a schoolmaster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that accounts for your educated way of
speaking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, father died when I was quite a baby, but my
grandfather sent me to school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you live with your mother, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I live alone here.&nbsp; This farm belongs to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not help peeping out beneath her lashes to judge of
the effect of her words, and was gratified when the busy brush
paused and the dark eyes glanced down at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You live alone here?&nbsp; But this is a big
farm&mdash;you can&rsquo;t manage it all yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&lsquo;Yes, I do.&nbsp; It is hard work, but I contrive
to do it.&nbsp; I am rather lonely, though.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will be remedied in time,&rsquo; said the artist
encouragingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The right man will come along, and
perhaps,&rsquo; he added with that queer smile of his, &lsquo;you
won&rsquo;t find him so ugly as the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know who I am or you would n&rsquo;t
speak like that,&rsquo; said Rosalie with dignity; adding, with a
softer inflexion of her voice: &lsquo;The right man has
come&mdash;and gone.&nbsp; I am a widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And unclasping the hands beneath her head, she thrust forward
the left one with the shining wedding-ring.</p>
<p>Confusion and concern now replaced the careless gaiety of the
stranger&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said earnestly; &lsquo;I
did not know.&nbsp; You look so young&mdash;I could not
guess&mdash;but I am very sorry for my foolish talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was married four years,&rsquo; said Rosalie
softly.&nbsp; Something gentle and kindly about the man invited
confidence.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor Elias has only been dead three
months.&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused abruptly, astonished at the
sudden expression of blank bewilderment on the other&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your husband&rsquo;s name was Elias&rsquo; he
queried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg your pardon for what must seem <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>idle
curiosity.&nbsp; Was it&mdash;was it his grave that I saw you
visiting the other day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rosalie, sighing and blushing;
&lsquo;yes: I&mdash;I thought I was alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Aged sixty-two</i>!&rsquo; quoted the artist to
himself, and he raised his hand to his mouth for a moment to
conceal its tell-tale quivering.&nbsp; He thought of the
girl&rsquo;s elastic gait on the morning when he had first seen
her, and scrutinised once more the blooming face and admirably
proportioned form before him; then, shaking his head slowly, went
on with his work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I shall call this picture &ldquo;The Sleeping
Beauty,&rdquo;&rsquo; he observed after a pause, with apparent
irrelevance.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know the story, don&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be a good
name.&nbsp; She was a Princess who went to sleep in a palace in
the wood, and I am just I&mdash;in my working dress, asleep in a
cornfield.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are mere details,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The main points of the story are the same.&nbsp; She woke
up all right, you know.&nbsp; You will wake up some day, too, my
beauty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put such meaning into the words, and smiled down at her so
oddly, that she felt confused and uncomfortable.&nbsp; It was not
that <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>her
pride was wounded at the liberty he had taken in applying such a
term to her: his admiration was so evidently impersonal that it
could not offend her, and, moreover, his allusion to his wife and
children had had a tranquillising effect.&nbsp; But the
man&rsquo;s look and tone when he made this strange remark filled
her with vague disquietude; both betrayed a secret amusement
mingled with something like compassion.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would
wake up some day,&rsquo; he said; but she did not want to wake
up!&nbsp; She was quite happy&mdash;at least, as happy as could
be in her bereaved state&mdash;she asked nothing more from
life.&nbsp; It would be certainly more unpleasant than the
reverse to discover that life had surprises in store for
her.&nbsp; But why need she trouble herself about a prophecy so
idly uttered, and by an absolute stranger?&nbsp; Nevertheless,
she did trouble herself, not only throughout the remainder of the
time that the artist was completing his sketch, but frequently
afterwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will wake up some day, my beauty!&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh
no, no; let her sleep on if this placid contented existence were
indeed sleep; let her dream away the days in peace, until that
time of awakening which would re-unite her to Elias.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the artist had gone away,
after lingering some days longer to complete his studies for the
projected picture, the tenor of Rosalie&rsquo;s existence flowed
on as calmly as even she could desire.&nbsp; She made and sold
her butter; had her cheeses conveyed to Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s
establishment in Branston; superintended the harvesting of her
potatoes and mangels; laid in her winter store of oil-cake; and
fattened sundry turkeys and geese for the Christmas market.</p>
<p>Early on a winter&rsquo;s afternoon Rosalie Fiander might have
been seen walking slowly across the downs in the neighbourhood of
Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; She carried a large basket, and
every now and then paused to add to <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>the store of scarlet berries or
shining evergreen which she was culling from thicket and hedgerow
for Christmas decoration.</p>
<p>All at once she was surprised by hearing a step on the path
behind her and a man&rsquo;s voice calling her name, and,
turning, descried the tall and somewhat ungainly person of Andrew
Burge.</p>
<p>Though it wanted yet a few days of Christmas, that gentleman,
who was of a social turn of mind, had evidently begun to
celebrate the festival, and Rosalie, gazing at him, was somewhat
dismayed on perceiving the flushed hilarity of his countenance
and the devious gait by which he approached.</p>
<p>She paused reluctantly, however, and shook hands with him when
he came up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling at your place, Mrs.
Fiander,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;to wish you the compliments
of the season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rsquo; said
Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;The same to you, Mr. Burge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the young man, rolling an amorous eye
at her, &lsquo;I was most wishful, Mrs. Fiander, to give you my
Christmas greetings in person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish
you a merry Christmas and a happy New <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Year.&nbsp; And now I think I must
be moving home, for I am very busy to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allow me to escort you,&rsquo; urged Andrew.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;T was a disapp&rsquo;intment to me not to find you
at home.&nbsp; I am rej&rsquo;iced to have overtaken you, and
anxious to prorogue the interview.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a season
for condoliances and a season for congratulations.&nbsp; This
here is the time for congratulations, and I am anxious, Mrs.
Fiander, ma&rsquo;am, to prorogue it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My work is waiting for me at home,&rsquo; said the
young widow in alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid I shall have no
time to attend to you; but, perhaps, some other
day&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She broke off and began to walk away rapidly; but the uneven,
lumbering steps kept pace with hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christmas comes but once a year,&rsquo; remarked Mr.
Burge, somewhat thickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is a joyful
season&mdash;a season as fills a man&rsquo;s &rsquo;eart with
&rsquo;ope and &rsquo;appiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This observation appearing to call for no rejoinder, Rosalie
let it pass unnoticed except by a slight quickening of her pace;
to no purpose, however, for her unwelcome companion kept by her
side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christmas for ever!&rsquo; he ejaculated huskily, with
an appropriate flourish of his hat. <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Instead of restoring it to its place
after this sudden display of enthusiasm, he continued to wave it
uncertainly, not over his own head, but over Rosalie&rsquo;s,
leering the while in a manner which materially increased her
discomposure.&nbsp; All at once she saw that a sprig of mistletoe
was tucked into the band of Mr. Burge&rsquo;s head-gear, and
almost at the moment she made this discovery he lurched forward,
so as to bar her progress, and bent his face towards hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dare you!&rsquo; cried Rosalie, thrusting him from
her with a vigorous push; then, as he momentarily lost his
equilibrium and staggered backwards against the hedge, she fairly
took to her heels and fled from him at full speed, not towards
her own home, but to Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s premises.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Mr. Sharpe!&rsquo; she cried breathlessly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, oh, save me!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s after me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s arter you, my dear?&nbsp; Why, you be
a-shakin&rsquo; same as an aspen-tree.&nbsp; What in the name
o&rsquo; Goodness has put you in such a state?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s that dreadful Andrew
Burge.&nbsp; He overtook me on the downs and tried to kiss
me.&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;s tipsy, and I know he&rsquo;s running
after me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&lsquo;Nay now, my dear, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on
so.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not hurt ye here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see to
that.&nbsp; Dang his impidence!&nbsp; Tried to kiss ye, did
he?&nbsp; That chap needs to be taught his place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s coming down the path
now,&rsquo; cried Rosalie, wringing her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
dear, if he does n&rsquo;t come here I dare say he&rsquo;ll go
back to the farm, and I shall find him there when I go
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go on shakin&rsquo; and
cryin&rsquo; so.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye be so excited,
Rosalie,&rsquo; said Isaac, who was himself very red in the face
and violently perturbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll walk home
along of ye, and if I do find him there I&rsquo;ll settle
him&mdash;leastways, if you&rsquo;ll give me leave.&nbsp; Ye
don&rsquo;t want to have nothin&rsquo; more to say to &rsquo;en,
do ye?&nbsp; Very well, then, &rsquo;t will be easy enough to get
rid of &rsquo;en.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Isaac Sharpe, without pausing to pull a coat over his
smock-frock, duly escorted Mrs. Fiander across the downs and home
by the short cut; and, as Rosalie had surmised, Susan greeted
them on the threshold with the pleasing information that Mr.
Burge was waiting for her in the parlour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leave
&rsquo;en to me, my dear.&nbsp; Jist you go to the dairy, or up
to your room, or anywheres ye like out o&rsquo; the <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>road.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not be very slack in getting through wi&rsquo; this
here job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He watched her until she had disappeared from view, and then
suddenly throwing open the parlour door shouted in stentorian
tones to its solitary occupant:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then, you must get out o&rsquo; this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Burge, who had been sitting in a somnolent condition before
the fire, woke up, and stared in surprise mingled with alarm at
the white-robed giant who advanced threateningly towards him
through the dusk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what does this mean?&rsquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; repeated the farmer in
thundering tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;It means that you&rsquo;re a
rascal, young fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Isaac qualified the statement with one or two specimens of
&lsquo;language&rsquo; of the very choicest kind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, eh,&rsquo; he pursued, standing
opposite the chair where Andrew sat blinking, &lsquo;by running
arter young females on them there lonesome downs, when you was
not fit for nothin&rsquo; but a public bar, frightenin&rsquo;
her, and insultin&rsquo; her till she was very near took with a
fit on my doorstep?&nbsp; What do ye mean, ye villain, eh?&nbsp;
If ye was n&rsquo;t so drunk that ye could n&rsquo;t stand up to
me for a minute <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>I&rsquo;d have ye out in that there yard and I&rsquo;d
give ye summat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burge shrank as far back in his chair as was compatible
with a kind of tipsy dignity, and inquired mildly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what business is it of yours, Mr.
Sharpe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my business that I won&rsquo;t have
&rsquo;Lias Fiander&rsquo;s widow insulted nor yet put upon, nor
yet bothered by folks as she don&rsquo;t want to ha&rsquo;
nothin&rsquo; to say to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; protested Andrew&mdash;&lsquo;Mr.
Sharpe, I cannot permit such interference.&nbsp; My intentions
was honourable.&nbsp; I meant matrimony, and I will not allow any
stranger to come between this lady and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye meant matrimony, did ye?&rsquo; said Isaac,
exchanging his loud, wrathful tone for one of withering
scorn.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Fiander does n&rsquo;t mean matrimony,
though&mdash;not wi&rsquo; the likes o&rsquo; you.&nbsp; Come,
you clear out o&rsquo; this; and don&rsquo;t you never go for to
show your ugly mug here again, or my cluster o&rsquo; five will
soon be no stranger to it, I promise you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He held up a colossal hand as he spoke, first extending the
fingers in illustration of his threat, and then clenching it into
a redoubtable fist.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Andrew sat upright in the elbow-chair, his
expressionless eyes staring stolidly at his assailant, but
without attempting to move.&nbsp; Through the open door the sound
of whispers and titters could have been heard had either of the
men been in a condition to notice such trivial matters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, then!&rsquo; repeated Sharpe threateningly.</p>
<p>Andrew Burge drew himself up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This contumacious behaviour, Mr. Sharpe, sir,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;has no effect upon me whatever.&nbsp; My intentions
is to make an equivocal offer of marriage to Mrs. Fiander, and
from her lips alone will I take my answer.&nbsp; I shall sit in
this chair,&rsquo; he continued firmly, &lsquo;until the lady
comes in person to give me her responsory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will, will ye?&rsquo; bellowed Isaac.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ye be a-goin&rsquo; to sit there, be ye?&nbsp; Ye
bain&rsquo;t, though!&nbsp; That there chair&rsquo;s my chair
I&rsquo;d have ye know, and I&rsquo;ll soon larn ye who have got
the right to sit in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he lunged forward, thrusting the cluster of five so
suddenly into Andrew&rsquo;s face that that gentleman threw
himself heavily backwards, and the chair, being unprovided with
castors, overbalanced, and fell violently to the ground.</p>
<p>Undeterred by the catastrophe and the <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>peculiar
appearance presented by Mr. Burge&rsquo;s flushed and dazed
countenance as he stared helplessly upwards, contemplating
probably a thousand stars, Isaac seized the chair by the legs and
began to drag it across the floor, bumping its occupant
unmercifully in his exertions.&nbsp; His own countenance was,
indeed, almost as purple in hue as Andrew&rsquo;s by the time he
reached the door, which was obligingly thrown open as he neared
it, revealing Sam Belbin&rsquo;s delighted face.&nbsp; The
alarmed countenances of the maids peered over his shoulder, while
a few manly forms were huddled together in the passage.&nbsp; Mr.
Sharpe&rsquo;s extremely audible tones had attracted many eager
listeners; nothing so exciting had taken place at Littlecomb
since Elias Fiander&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, you chaps,&rsquo; cried the farmer, still tugging
violently at the chair, and panting with his efforts;
&lsquo;here, come on, some on you.&nbsp; Lend a hand to get rid
o&rsquo; this here carcase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing loath, the men sprang forward, and between them the
chair with its occupant was dragged out of the room and along the
passage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s he been a-doin&rsquo; of?&rsquo; inquired
Sam with great gusto, as he dropped his particular chair-leg on
the cobble-stones in the yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you mind what he&rsquo;ve been a-doin&rsquo; <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of,&rsquo;
returned Isaac, straightening himself and wiping his brow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Get him out of that there chair, and trot him off the
premises&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you &rsquo;ve a-got to
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Burge was with some difficulty set on his legs, and
after gazing vacantly round him appeared to recover a remnant of
his scattered senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll summons you, Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The liberties of the British subject is not
to be vi&rsquo;lently interfered with!&nbsp; I leave this
spot,&rsquo; he added, looking round loftily but unsteadily,
&lsquo;with contumely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anyone who had subsequently seen Sam and Robert conducting the
suitor to the high road would have endorsed the truth of this
remark, though Mr. Burge, according to his custom, had merely
used the first long word that occurred to him without any regard
to its appropriateness.</p>
<p>Returning to the house, Isaac went to the foot of the stairs
and called out Rosalie&rsquo;s name in a mildly jubilant
roar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come down, Mrs. Fiander; come down, my dear!&nbsp; He
be gone, and won&rsquo;t never trouble you no more, I&rsquo;ll
answer for &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie came tripping downstairs, smiling, in spite of a
faintly alarmed expression.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&lsquo;What a noise you did make, to be sure!&rsquo;
she remarked; &lsquo;and what a mess the parlour is
in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We did knock down a few things, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,
when we was cartin&rsquo; &rsquo;en out of this,&rsquo; returned
Isaac apologetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a-settin&rsquo; in my
chair, and he up and told me to my face as he&rsquo;d go on
a-settin&rsquo; there till he seed &rsquo;ee&mdash;that were
comin&rsquo; it a bit too strong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was helping her as he spoke to pick up the scattered
furniture, and to restore the table-cloth and books, which Andrew
had dragged down in falling, to their places.</p>
<p>These tasks ended, he faced her with a jovial smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he won&rsquo;t trouble you
again, anyhow.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; your
coortin&rsquo; chaps a-gone for good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you could get rid of them all in the same
way,&rsquo; said Rosalie gratefully; adding in a confidential
tone, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s Mr. Wilson, now&mdash;he keeps calling
and calling, and he follows me about, and pays me
compliments&mdash;he is very tiresome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be he?&rsquo; returned the farmer with a clouded
brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, and he bain&rsquo;t a chap for you to be
takin&rsquo; notice on, nohow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;en the

149</span>&lsquo;Why, you see, I don&rsquo;t like to be rude; and
he was kind about the pigs.&nbsp; But I wish some one would drop
him a hint that he is wasting his time in dangling about
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She broke off suddenly, for at that moment the interested and
excited countenance of Sam Belbin appeared in the doorway, and,
though he was a favourite with his mistress, she did not see fit
to discuss such intimate affairs in his hearing.</p>
<p>The news of Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s encounter with young Andrew
Burge soon flew round the neighbourhood, evoking much comment,
and causing constructions to be placed upon the farmer&rsquo;s
motives which, if he had heard them, would have sorely disquieted
that good man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He be a-goin&rsquo; to coort Widow Fiander hisself, for
certain,&rsquo; averred Mrs. Paddock.&nbsp; &lsquo;D&rsquo; ye
mind how I did say that day as there was all the trouble yonder
at Littlecomb&mdash;&ldquo;How nice,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;master
did speak of her!&rdquo;&mdash;d&rsquo; ye mind?&nbsp; He were
quite undone about her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pore young
creatur&rsquo;,&rdquo; says he, so feelin&rsquo; as he
could.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo; ye mind?&nbsp; Mrs. Belbin,&rdquo; I
said, says I, &ldquo;master be a very feelin&rsquo;
man.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I can mind as you said that,&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Belbin; &lsquo;but my Sam he d&rsquo; &rsquo;low as Mrs. <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Fiander
would n&rsquo;t so much as look at master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
another old man,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; And, mind ye,&rsquo; added
Mrs. Belbin, confidentially dropping her voice,
&lsquo;Sam&rsquo;s missus do think a deal o&rsquo; he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Paddock folded her arms, and looked superciliously at her
neighbour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;your Sam &rsquo;ull
find hisself mistook if he gets set on sich a notion as
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What notion?&rsquo; returned the other
innocently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never said nothin&rsquo; about no
notion at all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a-got such a suspectin&rsquo;
mind, Mrs. Paddock, there&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; you a bit
o&rsquo; news wi&rsquo;out you up an&rsquo; take a body&rsquo;s
character away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the impending hostilities between the two
matrons were averted by the advent of a third&mdash;Mrs. Stuckhey
by name, wife of Robert Stuckhey, who worked at Littlecomb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My &rsquo;usband did say,&rsquo; she remarked,
negligently scratching her elbows, &lsquo;as Mr. Sharpe seemed
very intimate wi&rsquo; missus.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he
says to her.&nbsp; Ah, Stuckhey d&rsquo; say as Mr. Sharpe do
often call missus &ldquo;my dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he did say as
he seed &rsquo;en come walkin&rsquo; home wi&rsquo; her this
arternoon, quite lovin&rsquo; like, in a <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>smock-frock, jist the same as if he was in his own
place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go upstairs, my dear,&rdquo; says
he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In his <i>smock-frock</i>?&rsquo; interrupted Mrs.
Paddock eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were it a new smock-frock, did Mr.
Stuckhey say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very like it were,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Stuckhey,
accommodatingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master he bain&rsquo;t one as
takes much notice, and if it had a-been a old one he&rsquo;d
scarce ha&rsquo; thought o&rsquo; mentionin&rsquo; it to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you may depend, Mrs. Belbin,&rsquo; cried Mrs.
Paddock triumphantly, &lsquo;as master be a-coortin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; Widow Fiander!&nbsp; A new smock-frock! &rsquo;t is the
very thing as a man like he &rsquo;ud wear when his thoughts was
bent on sich matters!&nbsp; I do mind as my father told me often
how he did save an&rsquo; save for eleven weeks to buy hisself a
new smock to go a-coortin&rsquo; my mother in.&nbsp; Ah, wages
was terrible low then, and he were n&rsquo;t a-gettin&rsquo;
above seven shillin&rsquo; a week; but he did manage to put by a
shillin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; The smock&mdash;it were a
white &rsquo;un&mdash;did cost eleven shillin&rsquo;, and he did
save eleven weeks.&nbsp; And, strange to say, when he and my
mother did wed, they did have eleven children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Utterly routed by this incontrovertible <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>testimony,
Mrs. Belbin withdrew to her own quarters, leaving the other two
ragged heads bobbing together in high enjoyment of the delectable
piece of gossip.</p>
<p>Before the morrow the entire village knew that Farmer Sharpe
had arrived at Littlecomb with his arm round Widow
Fiander&rsquo;s waist, that he had spoken to her in the tenderest
terms, had avowed his intention of hammering each and every one
of her suitors, and had bought himself a brand-new and
beautifully embroidered smock-frock for the express purpose of
courting her in it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Isaac Sharpe did not
consider himself bound to assist Rosalie in repelling the
advances of Mr. Wilson, the auctioneer, the wish she had
expressed that someone would be kind enough to &lsquo;drop a hint
to him&rsquo; had fallen upon other attentive and willing
ears.</p>
<p>Sam Belbin had laid her words to heart, and only waited for an
opportunity of proving his good-will by ridding her of a frequent
and unwelcome visitor.</p>
<p>His chance came at last, and he was quick to take advantage of
it.</p>
<p>It was cheese-day, and Rosalie and her maids had prepared such
a quantity that their work was not, as usual, finished before
dinnertime, and they were still elbow-deep in curds when Mr.
Wilson chanced to look in.</p>
<p>Sam was standing in the outer room, swilling out the great
cheese-vat which had held <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>that morning a hundred and eighty
gallons of skim-milk.&nbsp; A wonderfully obliging fellow was
Sam, always ready to lend a hand here, to do an odd job there;
and so good-tempered with it all.&nbsp; His mistress could often
see his smiling mouth open and ready to agree with whatever
remark he thought her likely to make long before she had spoken;
and as she liked contradiction as little as any of her sex her
head-man advanced the more rapidly in her favour.</p>
<p>She was anything but gratified when Mr. Wilson appeared on the
threshold of the milk-house, and after a brief greeting bent her
head over her mould and went on with her work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always busy, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; remarked the visitor
pleasantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, you ladies put us to
shame sometimes.&nbsp; We men are idle creatures in comparison
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie made no answer, and Sam banged about the vat with his
stiff brush so energetically that he seemed bent on giving the
lie to the auctioneer&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am really quite curious to see how you set about your
cheese-making,&rsquo; pursued the latter in mellifluous
tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Should I be in <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>your way, Mrs. Fiander, if I was to
step in and watch you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you would n&rsquo;t find it very
amusing,&rsquo; responded Rosalie unwillingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course, if you like.&nbsp; But it will really be most
uncomfortable for you.&nbsp; We are all in such a mess
here.&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;&mdash;irritably&mdash;&lsquo;what a din
you do make with that tub!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sam, who had tilted up the tub, the better apparently to scrub
the bottom, now let it go suddenly, sending a great portion of
its contents splashing across the floor in Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It be all the same,&rsquo; he remarked philosophically;
&lsquo;I were just a-goin&rsquo; to swill out this here
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with that he upset a little more of the steaming water
upon the floor, seized a stiff broom, and began to brush the
soapy liquid towards the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have waited a moment,&rsquo; commented his
mistress; but she spoke with a sweet smile, for she saw with the
corner of her eye how hastily Mr. Wilson had skipped out of the
way, anxious to protect his shining boots and immaculate
leggings.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really cannot invite you in now,&rsquo;
she added, turning to the visitor regretfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray
excuse the <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>man&rsquo;s awkwardness.&rsquo;&nbsp; But as she spoke
she smiled again on Sam.</p>
<p>She related the anecdote with much gusto to Isaac Sharpe on
the following Sunday, but he did not seem to appreciate it as
much as she had expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That there Wilson, he&rsquo;s arter you too, I
suppose.&nbsp; I would n&rsquo;t have anything to say to him if I
was you.&nbsp; He bain&rsquo;t steady enough to make a good
husband&mdash;racin&rsquo; an&rsquo; drinkin&rsquo;, and
sich-like.&nbsp; Ah, his poor wife, she did n&rsquo;t praise him,
but she suffered, poor soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gracious, Mr. Sharpe, I am sure you need n&rsquo;t warn
me!&nbsp; You know what my views are; besides, I hate the
man.&nbsp; I would n&rsquo;t see him at all if he had
n&rsquo;t&mdash;had n&rsquo;t been rather obliging in a
business-way.&nbsp; But was n&rsquo;t it clever of Sam to get rid
of him like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; agreed the farmer dubiously;
&lsquo;but don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go for to let &rsquo;en take too
much on hisself, my dear, else ye&rsquo;ll be like to repent
it.&nbsp; It do never do to let these young fellows get sot
up.&nbsp; Keep &rsquo;en in his place, Mrs. Fiander; don&rsquo;t
let &rsquo;en get presumptious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he would never be that,&rsquo; she
rejoined warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Sam; he&rsquo;s the humblest
creature in the world.&nbsp; He goes about his work
like&mdash;like a machine.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&lsquo;May be so,&rsquo; said Isaac incredulously;
&lsquo;you know him best, I suppose, but I jist thought I&rsquo;d
speak my mind out about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie frowned a little and said no more, but her faith in
Sam was not diminished, and as time went on she grew to rely more
and more on this cheerful and obliging young fellow.</p>
<p>The gossiping anent the alleged courting of Mrs. Fiander by
Farmer Sharpe was not confined to Littlecomb Village, but soon
spread to the more important town of Branston, with the immediate
result of stirring up sundry of the young men belonging to that
place, who, after the discomfiture of Samuel Cross, had deemed it
prudent to relax for a time in their attentions to the
fascinating widow.&nbsp; So long as she had been thought plunged
in grief, these wooers of hers had been content to bide their
time; but when it became known that there was actually an avowed
suitor in the field, and one, moreover, to whom the lady had
given unequivocal tokens of confidence and good-will, they
resolved with one accord to bestir themselves, lest the prize of
which each thought himself most deserving, might be secured by
another.</p>
<p>Before many days of the new year had <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>passed
Rosalie found herself absolutely besieged.&nbsp; Samuel Cross
actually forced his way past the unwilling Susan into the parlour
while Rosalie was at tea; Mr. Wilson lay in wait for her as she
was emerging from church on Christmas Day, and made his proposal
in due form as he escorted her homewards.&nbsp; John Hardy
inveigled the widow into the back parlour behind the shop,
ostensibly to discuss the sale of the Blue Vinneys, in reality to
lay his hand and heart at her feet.</p>
<p>Rosalie said &lsquo;No&rsquo; to one and all, and was
astonished at the outburst of indignation which her answer
provoked, and at the keen sense of ill-usage under which every
one of her suitors appeared to be labouring.</p>
<p>It was Samuel Cross who first alluded in Rosalie&rsquo;s
hearing to the prevalent belief that Farmer Sharpe was paying his
court to her; and he was somewhat taken aback by the unfeigned
merriment which the suggestion evoked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may laugh, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he said, recovering
himself after an instant, &lsquo;but people are not blind and
deaf; and, though they may be fooled to a certain extent by a
lady, gentlemen of my profession find it easy to put two and two
together, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; When a lady tells <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>you she is
always engaged on a Sunday, and shuts the door in the face of a
person who comes to make civil inquiries, one does n&rsquo;t need
to be extra clever to guess that there must be some reason for
it.&nbsp; And when the reason turns out to be another gentleman,
and when that gentleman takes upon himself to assault another
gentleman as was also desirous of paying his respects in the same
quarter, that, Mrs. Fiander, is what one may term
<i>prim&acirc;-facie</i> evidence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether the display of Mr. Cross&rsquo;s learning had a
sobering effect on Mrs. Fiander, or whether she was suddenly
struck by some serious thought, it is certain that she ceased
laughing at this juncture, and remained pensive even after the
rejected suitor had departed.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson was harder to get rid of.&nbsp; He was so confident
in the justice of his claim, so pertinacious in reminding Rosalie
of her obligations towards him with regard to the sales of the
pigs&mdash;which piece of business he perseveringly alluded to as
&lsquo;a delicate matter&rsquo;&mdash;so persuaded, moreover, of
his own superiority to any of her other lovers, that she finally
lost patience and petulantly declared that if there were not
another man in the world she would not consent to marry him.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>The
auctioneer grew purple in the face, and suddenly changed his
note:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there was n&rsquo;t another man in the world!&rsquo;
he repeated sneeringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then there is another
man?&nbsp; Ha! it is n&rsquo;t very hard to guess who!&nbsp;
Well, tastes differ.&nbsp; If you like such a rough, common old
chap better than a gentleman doing a large and honourable
business, I make you a present of him, Mrs. Fiander, smock-frock
and all!&nbsp; Ha, ha, he&rsquo;ll soon have the pigs back again
when he&rsquo;s master here, and all my labour and loss of time
will have been thrown away.&nbsp; Not that I grudge the
sacrifice,&rsquo; cried Mr. Wilson in a melting tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, far be it from me to grudge the sacrifice.&nbsp; The
ladies have always found an easy prey in me; and when I think of
the far greater sacrifice which a young and lovely woman is
prepared to make upon the altar of matrimony&mdash;a sacrifice
which she will repent too late&mdash;I am rejooced to
silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Wilson thumped his breast and cast a last languishing
look at the young widow, who appeared, however, to be absorbed in
her own reflections.</p>
<p>He talked on in spite of his last assertion until they reached
Rosalie&rsquo;s door, where, <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>waking as if from a dream, she
extended her hand to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no use
in talking about it any more, Mr. Wilson; my mind is made
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The auctioneer extended his hand dramatically in the direction
of the empty pigsties.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;if the
Inspector of Nuisances visits your premises you will only have
yourself to thank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meanwhile,&rsquo; retorted Rosalie with some acerbity,
&lsquo;as it might be a little difficult to send for him to-day,
I should be glad if the nuisance who is now occupying my premises
would take himself off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went into the house with a flushed face, but seemed more
thoughtful than annoyed during the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>It was, however, with unmixed vexation that she perused, on
the morning following her rejection of young John Hardy, a
document signed by the firm, which ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Fiander</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;<i>Re</i> Blue Vinney
Cheeses.&mdash;We regret to inform you that we can no longer
allow our premises to be used as a storehouse for these
unsaleable articles.&nbsp; In the three months during which, in
order to oblige you, we have placed our <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>establishment at your disposal, we have only found one
purchaser for a small portion of the goods in question (as you
will see per statement copied from our books and enclosed
herewith).&nbsp; Under these circumstances we are returning to
you to-day as many of the cheeses as the carrier&rsquo;s cart can
convey, and we shall be obliged by your removing the remainder at
your earliest convenience.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">We are, Madam, yours obediently,<br
/>
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Hardy</span> &amp; <span
class="smcap">Son</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enclosed &lsquo;statement&rsquo; testified to the purchase
by one Margaret Savage of &frac34; lb. Blue Vinney C<sup>se</sup>
at 5&frac34;<i>d.</i> = 4<i>d.</i>, which sum had been credited
to Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>Rosalie gave a little gasp, and tears of vexation sprang to
her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They just want to spite me,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Of course the cheeses are hardly fit for use
yet&mdash;they can&rsquo;t have even tried to dispose of them;
they simply pretended to sell them so as to entrap me, and now
they are throwing them back on my hands before I have time to
think what to do with them.&nbsp; That odious John Hardy!&nbsp;
Mean-spirited wretch&mdash;it is all his doing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as she thus cogitated there was a rattling of wheels
without, and the carrier&rsquo;s cart drew up with a flourish at
the door.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&lsquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; cried Susan,
thrusting in her head, &lsquo;Mr. Smith be here with ever so many
cheeses as he says Hardys are sending back; and there&rsquo;s
sixteen-and-eightpence to pay; and he says, ma&rsquo;am, will you
please send the men to unload them at once?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call Sam,&rsquo; said her mistress in a strangled
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell him to come at once with two or three of
the others, and to take the cheeses carefully
upstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the cheese-room be a&rsquo;most full,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I doubt there&rsquo;ll not be much room for
them there.&nbsp; We was waitin&rsquo;, you know, till Christmas
had gone over a bit to send the last load to town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pile them up in the dairy, then, for the present.&nbsp;
Well, why don&rsquo;t you go?&rsquo; she cried, irritably, as the
girl remained staring at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Make the men get to
work at once while I find my purse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she came down from her room, purse in hand, she observed
through the staircase window the blank faces of Sam and his
underlings, as the carrier tossed the cheeses to them from the
cart, grinning the while as though at some excellent joke.&nbsp;
She stamped her foot, and caught her breath with a little angry
sob.&nbsp; She had been so proud in despatching <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>to Branston
load after load of these fine round cheeses, she had often
congratulated herself on the wisdom and cleverness of this
expedient of hers&mdash;and now to have them ignominiously thrown
back at her without having even disposed of one&mdash;to be
turned into a laughing-stock for her own folks as well as for the
whole town of Branston; to be actually made to pay for the
ill-success of her experiment!&nbsp; Rosalie was as a rule
open-handed and generous enough, but the disbursal of this
particular sixteen-and-eightpence caused her a pang of almost
physical anguish.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, when the carrier had departed and the men
returned to their work, she entered the dairy, and stood gazing
with clasped hands and a melancholy countenance at the heaps of
despised Blue Vinneys which were piled up on every side.</p>
<p>To her presently came Sam Belbin, his arms dangling limply by
his sides, his expression duly composed to sympathetic gloom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sam!&rsquo; exclaimed Rosalie in a heartbroken
tone, pointing tragically to the nearest yellow mound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would n&rsquo;t take on, I&rsquo;m sure, mum,&rsquo;
responded Sam with a ghastly smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay now, I would
n&rsquo;t take on.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was very ill <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>done
o&rsquo; Mr. Hardy&mdash;so everybody do say, but he&rsquo;s that
graspin&rsquo;&mdash;he never do care for sellin&rsquo; a bit
o&rsquo; cheese to poor folks&mdash;&rsquo;t is all bacon, bacon
wi&rsquo; he!&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go for to fill
your stummicks wi&rsquo; that there &rsquo;ard cheese,&rdquo; I
&rsquo;ve a-heard him say myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy a bit o&rsquo;
bacon as &rsquo;ull stand to ye hot or cold.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bacon!&rsquo; ejaculated Rosalie with a note of even
deeper woe.&nbsp; Then, pointing to the cheeses again, she
groaned: &lsquo;Oh, Sam, was it worth while getting rid of the
pigs&mdash;for this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive, mum,&rsquo; responded Belbin,
plucking up his courage, and speaking more cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Hardy bain&rsquo;t the only grocer in Branston!&nbsp;
There be a-many more as &rsquo;ud be proud an&rsquo; glad to sell
them cheeses for ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; Why, the story must be all over the town
by now&mdash;no one will look at them in Branston.&nbsp; Everyone
will know that Mr. Hardy packed them back to me.&nbsp; No, if I
sell them at all I must send them away somewhere&mdash;to
Dorchester, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and that &rsquo;ud be a good notion, mum,&rsquo;
commented Belbin.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d get a better price for
them there, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low.&nbsp; Lard!&nbsp; At
Dorchester the Blue Vinney cheeses do go off like
smoke.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>&lsquo;There is always a sale for them there, to be
sure,&rsquo; said Rosalie, somewhat less lugubriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And our own horses and carts &rsquo;ud take them there
in less than no time,&rsquo; pursued Sam, more and more
confidently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Things have just fell out lucky.&nbsp;
It be a-goin&rsquo; to take up to-night, and I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low there&rsquo;ll be some sharpish
frostiss&mdash;&rsquo;t will just exercise the horses nicely, to
get them roughed and make &rsquo;em carry them cheeses to
Dorchester&mdash;&rsquo;t will be the very thing as &rsquo;ull do
them good.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;ll cost ye nothing,&rsquo; he added
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Sam, you are a good comforter,&rsquo; cried his
mistress, brightening up under the influence of his
cheerfulness.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is a blessing, I am sure, to
have someone about one who does n&rsquo;t croak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned to him as she spoke with one of her radiant
smiles&mdash;a smile, however, which very quickly vanished, for
Sam&rsquo;s face wore a most peculiar expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear!&rsquo; he cried, casting an ardent look
upon her, &lsquo;I be main glad to hear ye say so!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d ax nothin&rsquo; better nor to be about ye always;
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d comfort an&rsquo; do for ye so well as I
could.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is a thing,&rsquo; he added, with modest
candour, &lsquo;as <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>I&rsquo;ve a-had in my mind for some time, but I did
n&rsquo;t like to speak afore.&nbsp; I was n&rsquo;t sure as
ye&rsquo;d relish the notion.&nbsp; But now as you&rsquo;ve
a-hinted so plain&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie had averted her face for a moment, but as he advanced
towards her with extended arm, she flashed round upon him a
glance which suddenly silenced him.</p>
<p>He remained staring at her with goggling eyes and a dropping
jaw during the awful pause which succeeded.</p>
<p>He heaved a sigh of relief, however, when she at last broke
silence, for she spoke calmly, and her words seemed innocuous
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that your coat hanging up behind the
door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mum,&rsquo; responded Sam, no longer the lover but
the very humble servant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and get it then.&nbsp; Your cap, I think, is on the
table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She fumbled in her pocket for a moment, and presently drew
forth her purse, from which she counted out the sum of fourteen
shillings.&nbsp; Her eyes had a steely glitter in them as she
fixed them on Sam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here are your week&rsquo;s wages,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take them, and walk out of this
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mum,&rsquo; pleaded Sam piteously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Missus&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&lsquo;Go out of this house,&rsquo; repeated Rosalie,
pointing mercilessly to the door; &lsquo;and never let me see
your face again.&nbsp; Out of my sight!&rsquo; she added quickly,
as he still hesitated.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s inarticulate protests died upon his lips, and he
turned and left her, Rosalie looking after him with gleaming eyes
until his figure was lost to sight.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Isaac Sharpe</span>, receiving no answer
to his knock, walked straight into the parlour.&nbsp; The room
was dark save for the smouldering glow of the fire, and it was
some time before he discovered Rosalie&rsquo;s figure huddled up
in Elias&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what be to do?&rsquo; he inquired, stooping over
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; returned she, with a strangled
sob, &lsquo;I have had such a day&mdash;I have been so
insulted.&nbsp; Oh, how shall I ever forget it!&nbsp; What can I
have done to bring about such a thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; cried the farmer, much alarmed,
&lsquo;whatever is it, my dear?&nbsp; Out wi&rsquo; it; and
let&rsquo;s have some light to see ourselves by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he seized the poker and stirred the logs on the
hearth, until they flared up with a brightness almost painful to
Rosalie&rsquo;s aching eyes.&nbsp; He saw the traces of tears
upon her flushed face, and his concern increased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard ye was in trouble again,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and I thought I&rsquo;d look in&mdash;Them cheeses as
ye&rsquo;ve been a-making of ever since midsummer is back on your
hands, they tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rosalie faintly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
are piles and piles of them in the dairy; and Mr. Hardy wrote a
most ill-natured letter about them, and everyone in the place
will think me a fool.&nbsp; But it is n&rsquo;t that I mind so
much&mdash;I shall sell those cheeses somewhere, I suppose, and I
know Mr. Hardy only sent them back out of spite because I would
n&rsquo;t marry John&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; put in Isaac, interested; &lsquo;John Hardy
axed ye, did he?&nbsp; And you would n&rsquo;t have
&rsquo;en?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; she returned petulantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. F.,&rsquo; said Isaac, leaning forward in
his chair, and speaking solemnly, &lsquo;ye mid ha&rsquo; done
worse nor take him.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is in my mind,&rsquo; he went
on emphatically, &lsquo;as soon or <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>late ye&rsquo;ll have to take a
second.&nbsp; But, tell me, what was it as upset ye so much
to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost ashamed to say it.&nbsp; Sam
Belbin&mdash;you know Sam, that common lad that I made cowman out
of pure kindness and because I thought him
faithful&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;that lout, has actually dared to
make love to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; commented Isaac, nodding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you not amazed?&nbsp; Did you ever hear of such
impudence?&nbsp; He dared to call me &ldquo;my dear&rdquo;; and
he seemed to think that <i>I</i>, his mistress, had actually
encouraged him!&nbsp; He said something about my dropping a
hint.&nbsp; But I soon let him see what I thought of him.&nbsp; I
packed him off on the moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did ye?&rsquo; said Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, my
dear&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;Mrs. Fiander, I should
say&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course,&rsquo; she put in quickly, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind <i>your</i> saying <i>my dear</i>&mdash;&rsquo;t
is a very different matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as I was a-sayin&rsquo;,&rsquo; pursued the
farmer, ignoring these niceties, &lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t altogether
so very much surprised.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a-heard some queer talk
about you and Sam Belbin&mdash;only this very day I&rsquo;ve
a-heard queer talk&mdash;and, to say the truth, that were the
reason why <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>I looked in this arternoon&mdash;I thought it best not
to wait till Sunday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not one to meddle, but I
thought it only kind to let ye know what folks in the village be
sayin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sharpe!&rsquo;&mdash;and her eyes positively
blazed&mdash;&lsquo;do you mean to tell me that people know me so
little as to gossip about me and that low fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, my dear,&rsquo; cried Isaac, catching the infection
of her excitement, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no knowing what folks do
say&mdash;they be ready to believe any scandelious thing.&nbsp;
Why, Bithey did actually tell me &rsquo;t is common talk o&rsquo;
the village as you and me be a-goin&rsquo; to make a match of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie, who had been leaning forward in her chair, suddenly
sank back; she drew a long breath, and then said in a very small
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Isaac, I believe it will have to come to
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not even Sam Belbin, withering under his mistress&rsquo;s
scornful gaze, had stared at her with such blank dismay as that
now perceptible on Farmer Sharpe&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Rosalie covered her own with both hands, but presently dropped
them again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything points to it,&rsquo; she said firmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You see yourself things cannot go on as they <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>are.&nbsp;
I find I can&rsquo;t manage the men&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here her voice broke, but she pursued after a minute:
&lsquo;Even the work which I am competent to undertake has not
succeeded.&nbsp; Elias would be sorely grieved to see everything
going wrong like this, he who was such a good man of
business&mdash;always so regular and particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; groaned Isaac, &lsquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,
it &rsquo;ud very near break his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be a master here,&rsquo; went on
Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even you were forced to own just now that I
ought to marry again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; agreed Isaac unwillingly, &lsquo;oh,
&rsquo;ees, it &rsquo;ud be a very good thing; but
I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, gazing at her with an expression almost akin to
terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose for a moment,&rsquo; she cried with
spirit, &lsquo;that I would ever consent to put a stranger in my
dear Elias&rsquo;s place?&nbsp; Could you&mdash;you who have been
his friend so long, bear to see one of the Branston
counter-jumpers master here?&nbsp; I wonder at you, Isaac
Sharpe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now,&rsquo; protested the farmer; &lsquo;I did
n&rsquo;t say I wished no such thing, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; I said
&rsquo;t was my opinion as you&rsquo;d be forced to take a
second, and you might do worse nor think o&rsquo; John
Hardy.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&lsquo;Pray, is n&rsquo;t he a counter-jumper?&rsquo;
interrupted Rosalie vehemently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s others besides he,&rsquo; returned
Sharpe weakly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom would you choose, then?&rsquo; cried she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wilson, to drink, and race away my husband&rsquo;s
hard-earned money?&nbsp; Andrew Burge, perhaps, whom you drove
out of this house with your own hands?&nbsp; Or that little
ferret-faced Samuel Cross&mdash;he&rsquo;d know how to manage a
dairy-farm, would n&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d like to see him
strutting about, and giving orders here?&nbsp; I tell you what it
is, Isaac Sharpe, if you have no respect for dear Elias&rsquo;s
memory, you should be glad that I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who says I have n&rsquo;t respect for
&rsquo;Lias&rsquo;s memory?&rsquo; thundered Isaac, now almost
goaded into a fury.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known &rsquo;en a
deal longer nor you have, Widow Fiander, and there&rsquo;s no one
in this world as thought more on him.&nbsp; All I says is&mdash;I
bain&rsquo;t a marryin&rsquo; man&mdash;&rsquo;Lias knowed I were
n&rsquo;t never a marryin&rsquo; man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe,&rsquo; added Isaac, with an emphatic thump on the table,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe as if &rsquo;Lias were alive
he&rsquo;d expect it of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s dead, you see,&rsquo; returned Rosalie
with a sudden pathetic change of tone&mdash;&lsquo;he&rsquo;s
dead, and that is why everything is going <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>wrong.&nbsp; I should n&rsquo;t think of making a
change myself if I did n&rsquo;t feel it was the only thing to
do.&nbsp; You loved Elias; you knew his ways; you would carry on
the work just as he used to do&mdash;it would n&rsquo;t be like
putting a stranger in his place.&nbsp; I would n&rsquo;t do it if
I could help it,&rsquo; she added, sobbing; &lsquo;but I think
we&mdash;we should both try to do our duty by Elias.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac, visibly moved, rolled his eyes towards her and heaved a
mighty sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, if you put it that way,&rsquo; he began; and
then his courage failed him, and be became once more mute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would n&rsquo;t be such a bad thing for you, Mr.
Sharpe,&rsquo; went on Rosalie faintly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is
a very fine farm, and a good business.&nbsp; It would be
convenient for you to work the two farms together.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d have quite a large property&mdash;and this is a very
comfortable house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; agreed Isaac, &lsquo;&rsquo;t is a good
house, but I have n&rsquo;t no need for two houses.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m content wi&rsquo; the one where I were born.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but that won&rsquo;t do at all,&rsquo; cried
Rosalie with sudden animation; &lsquo;you would have to live
here&mdash;the object of my marrying you would be that you should
live here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a-lived in my own house ever sin&rsquo; I <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>were
born,&rsquo; said the farmer obstinately, &lsquo;and when a man
weds he takes his wife to live wi&rsquo; him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not when the wife has got the best house of the
two,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Fiander.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man can&rsquo;t live in two houses,&rsquo; asserted
Isaac; adding, after a pause: &lsquo;What would ye have me do
with mine, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could put your head-man to live in it,&rsquo;
returned she, &lsquo;paying you rent, of course.&nbsp; Or you
could let it to somebody else&mdash;you would make money in that
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One by one Isaac&rsquo;s entrenchments were being carried: no
resource remained open to him but to capitulate or to take
flight.&nbsp; He chose the latter alternative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is not a thing as a body can make up his mind
to in a hurry,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must think it over,
Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then before she could make the sharp retort which had risen to
her lips he had darted to the door.</p>
<p>As it closed behind him Rosalie sprang to her feet, and began
to pace hastily about the room.&nbsp; What had she done?&nbsp;
She had actually in so many words made an offer of marriage to
Isaac Sharpe&mdash;and she was not quite sure of being
accepted!&nbsp; There was the rub!&nbsp; <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Elias was
an old man, yet he had wooed her, in her homeless, penniless
condition, with a certain amount of ardour.&nbsp; In her
widowhood she had been courted, doubtless as much on account of
her wealth as of her beauty, but certainly with no lack of
eagerness.&nbsp; And now, when she had turned with affectionate
confidence to this old friend, and practically laid herself, her
good looks, and good fortune at his feet, he had promised
unwillingly to think it over.&nbsp; It was not to be
endured&mdash;she would send him to the right-about on his
return, let his decision be what it might.&nbsp; But then came
the sickening remembrance of the failures and humiliations which
had attended her unassisted enterprises; the importunities of
distasteful suitors&mdash;worst of all, the confident leer on Sam
Belbin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Great Heavens!&nbsp; What a miserable
fate was hers!&nbsp; She dared not so much as trust a servant but
he must needs try to take advantage of her unprotected
condition.</p>
<p>The lamp was lit and tea set forth, but Rosalie left it
untasted upon the table.&nbsp; She was still pacing restlessly
about the room when Isaac walked in; this time without any
preliminary knock.</p>
<p>He closed the door behind him and <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>advanced towards the young woman,
his face wearing a benign if somewhat sheepish smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be come to tell you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as
I&rsquo;ve come round to the notion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, beaming down at her with the air of a man who was
making an indubitably pleasant announcement; and Rosalie, who was
gifted with a very genuine sense of humour, could not for the
life of her help laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; repeated Isaac valiantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a-comed round to the notion.&nbsp; I was
al&rsquo;ays a bit shy o&rsquo; materimony, by reason o&rsquo;
the cat-and-dog life as my mother and father did lead; but I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low as I&rsquo;ve no need to be fearful about
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re made different, my dear; and ye&rsquo;ve
been a good wife to &rsquo;Lias.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more,&rsquo;
he went on cheerfully, &lsquo;as I was a-thinkin&rsquo; to
myself, &rsquo;t is n&rsquo;t same as if I was to go and put
myself in the wrong box, so to speak, by beggin&rsquo; and
prayin&rsquo; of ye to have me; then ye mid very well cast up at
me some day if I was n&rsquo;t <i>satisfied</i> wi&rsquo; the
bargain.&nbsp; But when a young woman comes and axes a man as a
favour to marry her it be a different story, bain&rsquo;t
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie stopped laughing and glanced at him indignantly.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the way in which you look at it,
Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I think we had better give up
the idea.&nbsp; How dare you,&rsquo; she burst out
suddenly&mdash;&lsquo;how dare you tell me to my face that I
asked you as a favour?&nbsp; I am not the kind of person to pray
and beseech you.&nbsp; You know as well as I do that other people
are ready to fall on their knees if I but hold up a
finger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, a good few of them are,&rsquo; agreed Isaac
dispassionately; &lsquo;but ye don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em, ye
see.&nbsp; Well, and at the first go off, when I was took by
surprise, so to speak, I thought I did n&rsquo;t want you.&nbsp;
Not as I&rsquo;ve any personal objections to you,&rsquo; he added
handsomely, &lsquo;but because I never reckoned on changing my
state.&nbsp; But now, as I&rsquo;ve a-thought it over, I&rsquo;m
agreeable, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie remained silent, her eyes downcast, her hands
nervously clasping and unclasping each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;to
do my dooty by &rsquo;Lias and my dooty by you, Rosalie.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve been a good wife to he, and ye&rsquo;ll be the same
to me, I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, passing his hand meditatively over his grizzled
locks and probably comforting himself with the reflection that in
this <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>case at least there would be no need to supply himself
with such a box as that so often dolefully shown to him by his
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to do my duty by Elias,&rsquo; said the poor
young widow at last, in a choked voice, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t
want you to sacrifice yourself, since you feel it is a
sacrifice.&nbsp; If you hate me so much don&rsquo;t marry me,
Isaac,&rsquo; she added passionately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, my dear, who ever said I hated &rsquo;ee?&nbsp;
Far from it!&nbsp; I do like &rsquo;ee very much; I&rsquo;ve
liked &rsquo;ee from the first.&nbsp; &rsquo;Lias knowed I liked
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Say no more about a sacrifice; it bain&rsquo;t
no sacrifice to speak on.&nbsp; I was real upset to see how bad
you was a-gettin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be a comfort to
think as I can look arter you, and look arter the place.&nbsp;
You and me was al&rsquo;ays the best o&rsquo; friends, and
we&rsquo;ll go on bein&rsquo; the best o&rsquo; friends when we
are man and wife.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say no fairer than
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stretched out his large brown palm, and Rosalie laid her
cold fingers in it, and the compact was concluded by a silent
hand-shake.</p>
<p>Then Isaac, who was a practical man, pointed out to Rosalie
that her tea was growing cold, and remarked placidly that he
would smoke a bit of a pipe by the fire while she partook of
it.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>As
she approached the table and began tremulously to fill her cup he
drew forward a chair and sat down.</p>
<p>Rosalie glanced round at him and started; the new era had
already begun.&nbsp; Isaac was sitting in Elias&rsquo;s
chair!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> lovely sparkling April day a
man was slowly pushing his bicycle up a certain steep incline
which is situated a little way out of Dorchester, and which is
known as Yellowham Hill.</p>
<p>The road climbed upwards between woods, the banks on either
side being surmounted by a dense growth of rhododendrons and
gorse, the latter in full bloom, its brilliant yellow contrasting
with the glossy dark leaves of the <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>bushes behind, which were already
covered with a myriad of buds, and the little bronze crooks of
the bracken curling upwards through the moss beneath.</p>
<p>The long spring day wanted yet some hours of its close, but
already delicious spicy odours came forth from the woods, which
spoke of falling dew; and the birds were making mysterious
rustlings in the boughs, as though preparing to go to roost.</p>
<p>The young man paused every now and then to draw a long breath,
and to look round him with evident delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is good,&rsquo; he said to himself once.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is fairyland&mdash;the place is full of
magic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then a sudden change came over his face, and
he added: &lsquo;It is better than fairyland&mdash;it is
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a pleasant-looking young fellow, with a handsome
intelligent face and a tall well-knit figure.&nbsp; He had grey
eyes, very alert and keen in their expression, and when he smiled
his face lit up in an unexpected and attractive way.&nbsp; His
complexion was browner than might have been looked for in
connection with his hair, which was not very dark, and he had a
certain wideawake air as of one who had seen many men and
things.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>He
had almost reached the crest of the hill when his glance,
sweeping appreciatively over the curving bank at the turn of the
road, rested upon a woman&rsquo;s figure amid the tangle of
sunlit green and gold which crowned it.</p>
<p>Rosalie Fiander&mdash;who would be Rosalie Fiander for some
three months longer, it having been agreed between her and Isaac
that their marriage should not take place till her year&rsquo;s
widowhood was completed&mdash;had halted here on her return to
Branston, after a flying business-visit to Dorchester.</p>
<p>These Yellowham Woods had been much loved by her during her
childhood, and she had yielded to the temptation of alighting
from the gig to spend a few minutes in what had once been to her
a very paradise.</p>
<p>Nigger was placidly cropping the grass at a little distance
from her, and she had been on her way to re-enter the vehicle,
when she had paused for a last glance round.</p>
<p>She had marked, at first idly, then with some interest, the
figure which was toiling up the hill, feeling somewhat
embarrassed when she discovered on its nearer approach that she
was herself the object of a somewhat unusual scrutiny.&nbsp; The
grey eyes which looked at her so intently from out of the brown
face had a <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>very peculiar mixture of expressions.&nbsp; There was
curiosity in them and admiration&mdash;to that she was
accustomed&mdash;but there was something more: a wonder, an
almost incredulous delight.&nbsp; Thus might a man look upon the
face of a very dear friend whom he had not expected to
see&mdash;thus almost might he meet the sweetheart from whom he
had been parted for years.</p>
<p>As he approached the bank he slackened his pace, and presently
came to a standstill immediately beneath Rosalie&rsquo;s pinnacle
of moss-grown earth.</p>
<p>They remained face to face with each other for a moment or
two, Rosalie gazing down, fascinated, at the man&rsquo;s eyes, in
which the joyful wonder was growing ever brighter.&nbsp; Rousing
herself at last with an effort, and colouring high, she turned
and hastened along the crest of the bank until she came to the
gig, descended, rapidly gathered up the reins, and mounted into
the vehicle.</p>
<p>Seeing that the stranger, though he had begun to walk slowly
on, continued to watch her, and being, besides, annoyed and
confused at her own temporary embarrassment, she jerked the reins
somewhat sharply, and touched up Nigger with the whip.&nbsp; The
<a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>astonished animal, unaccustomed to such treatment,
started off at a brisk pace, and the gig rattled down the steep
incline with a speed which would have filled its late owner with
horror.</p>
<p>The disaster which he would certainly have prophesied was not
long in coming.&nbsp; Nigger&rsquo;s legs were not quite on a par
with his mettle, and presently, stumbling over a loose stone, he
was unable to recover himself, and dropped fairly and squarely on
both knees.</p>
<p>He was up in an instant, but Rosalie, jumping out of the cart,
and running to his head, uttered a cry of anguish.&nbsp; Through
the white patches of dust which testified to Nigger&rsquo;s
misfortune she saw blood trickling.&nbsp; A moment later rapid
footsteps were heard descending the hill, and the bicyclist came
to her assistance.</p>
<p>Bending forward, he carefully examined Nigger&rsquo;s knees,
and then turned to Rosalie; the curious expression which had so
puzzled and annoyed her having completely vanished and given
place to one of respectful concern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it is
not much&mdash;barely skin-deep&mdash;I doubt if there will be
any marks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has never been down before,&rsquo; said she <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>tearfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Nigger!&nbsp; Good old
fellow!&nbsp; I should n&rsquo;t have driven you so fast down the
hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His legs should be attended to at once,&rsquo; said the
stranger practically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you far to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes&mdash;sixteen miles.&nbsp; To
Branston.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He darted a keen glance at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Branston,&rsquo; he echoed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going
there myself to-morrow, or rather I am going to a place about a
mile this side of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I, too, stop a little this side of the
town,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;But poor Nigger will
never get so far.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; I must get home
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a village a mile or so from here,&rsquo;
observed the young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think your best plan would
be to leave the horse at the inn there.&nbsp; They would probably
lend you another to take you home.&nbsp; If you will get into the
trap I will lead the horse slowly back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, I will walk,&rsquo; cried Rosalie; &lsquo;I can
lead him myself,&rsquo; she added diffidently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to take you out of your way&mdash;besides, you
have your bicycle.&nbsp; I suppose you are going to
Dorchester?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can go to Dorchester any time,&rsquo; returned
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is merely a fancy of mine that takes <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>me
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a wish to see the old place again, having
been away from it for ten years.&nbsp; But I am really on my way
to visit my uncle.&nbsp; If you know Branston, I dare say you
have met him.&nbsp; He lives near Littlecomb Village, at a place
called the Down Farm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Isaac Sharpe!&rsquo; ejaculated Rosalie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Indeed, I do know him.&nbsp; I live next door to
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She broke off, not deeming it necessary to disclose, on so
short an acquaintance, her peculiar relations with the person in
question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; cried the young man gaily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is strange our meeting like this.&nbsp; I am Richard Marshall,
his nephew.&nbsp; You live next door to him, you say,&rsquo; he
added, with a puzzled look; &lsquo;then you must be&mdash;you
are&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; returned she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You remember Elias Fiander, of Littlecomb Farm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do; and I used to know his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have been so long away that a great many
changes have taken place.&nbsp; I was Elias Fiander&rsquo;s third
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was?&rsquo; cried he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rosalie blushing, she knew not
why.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear husband died last July.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The look of blank dismay which had <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>overspread the young man&rsquo;s
face gave way to an expression of relief; but he made no
reply.</p>
<p>Rosalie took hold of the nearest rein, turned Nigger round,
and began to lead him slowly up the hill again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can really manage quite well,&rsquo; she said,
somewhat stiffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must see you out of your difficulties,&rsquo;
returned the other with quiet determination; and he too began to
retrace his steps, pausing a moment at the crest of the hill to
repossess himself of his bicycle, which he had left propped
against the bank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will ride on to the village,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and make arrangements about leaving your horse there and
getting a fresh one.&nbsp; It will save time, and there is none
to spare if you want to get home before dusk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He raised his cap, mounted, and disappeared before Rosalie had
time to protest.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was glad enough of Richard Marshall&rsquo;s
helpful company when she presently arrived at the Black Horse
Inn, where, in spite of the framed poetical effusion which hung
beneath the sign, and which testified to the merits of the
establishment, there was some difficulty in procuring
accommodation and attention for poor Nigger, and even greater <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>in finding
a substitute.&nbsp; In fact, the only animal available proved to
be a huge rawboned three-year-old, who was with great difficulty
persuaded to enter the shafts of the gig, and who, when
harnessed, tilted up the vehicle in such a peculiar manner that
Rosalie shrank back in alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does n&rsquo;t look safe,&rsquo; she faltered;
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m quite sure that boy is n&rsquo;t capable of
driving him.&nbsp; I have been shaken by the fright, I suppose,
for I feel quite unnerved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will drive you,&rsquo; said Richard, with decision,
waving aside the lad who had been appointed charioteer and who
now began to assert his perfect competence to perform the
task.&nbsp; &lsquo;I guess I can manage most things in the way of
horseflesh; and in any case I intended to go to my uncle&rsquo;s
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; I could n&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rsquo; Rosalie
was beginning, when he interrupted her eagerly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing will be easier, I assure you; my bag is here,
strapped on to my bicycle.&nbsp; I meant to take my uncle by
surprise&mdash;he does n&rsquo;t know I am in England.&nbsp; You
can send back the horse to-morrow&mdash;even if you took the lad,
it would be difficult for him to return to-night.&nbsp; My
bicycle can stay here until I <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>send for it or fetch it.&nbsp;
Perhaps I had better get in first, Mrs. Fiander, to keep this
wild animal quiet, while you get up.&nbsp; Hand over the reins
here&mdash;that&rsquo;s it; hold on by his head till the lady
mounts.&nbsp; Put that machine of mine in a dry place, will
you?&nbsp; Now then, Mrs. Fiander, give me your hand.&nbsp; Whoa,
boy!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; There we are&mdash;Let go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laid the whip lightly on the animal&rsquo;s back, and they
were off before Rosalie had had time to protest or to demur.</p>
<p>The long legs of the three-year-old covered the ground in a
marvellous manner, and with that tall masterful figure by her
side she could feel no fear.&nbsp; Indeed the sensation of
swinging along through the brisk air was pleasant enough, though
she felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of the
astonishment which her arrival in such company would produce at
home; and she was, moreover, not quite certain if she relished
being thus peremptorily taken possession of by the
new-comer.&nbsp; Rosalie was used to think and act for herself
and it was quite a new experience to her to have her will
gainsaid and her objections overborne, even in her own
interests.&nbsp; But, after all, the man was Isaac&rsquo;s
nephew, and no one could find fault with her for accepting his
assistance.&nbsp; <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>In a few months&rsquo; time she would be his
aunt&mdash;perhaps he would then allow her wishes to have more
weight.&nbsp; She smiled to herself as she glanced up at
him&mdash;what would he say if she told him the relationship
which he would shortly bear to her?&nbsp; He would be her
nephew.&nbsp; How ridiculous it seemed!&nbsp; He must be some
years older than she was; there were firm lines in that brown
face, and the hands looked capable and strong, as if they had
accomplished plenty of work.</p>
<p>When they reached Yellowham Hill once more and began to
descend at a foot&rsquo;s pace, Richard broke silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen and done a good many things in the course
of my travels, but I have never come across so beautiful a spot
as this, and none of my adventures have been so curious as the
one which introduced me to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Rosalie drily; &lsquo;I cannot see
that there was anything so very extraordinary in it.&nbsp; Even
if Nigger had not had this accident we should have been certain
to meet while you are staying at Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said the young man, speaking half to
himself and half to her&mdash;&lsquo;I wonder if I should have
preferred to meet you first in your own fields&mdash;in a
cornfield.&nbsp; But the <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>corn, of course, will not be ripe
for months to come.&nbsp; No, on the whole I am content.&nbsp; I
said to myself when I was climbing the hill, &ldquo;There is
magic in this place,&rdquo; and I felt it was home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; said
Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can it matter where one first meets a
new acquaintance, and why should it be in a cornfield?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw you first in a cornfield,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely you were not in England last harvest
time,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you talking
about?&nbsp; You have only just said that you would like to
<i>have met</i> me first in a cornfield, which proves&mdash;what
is true&mdash;that you have never seen me before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen you before,&rsquo; he murmured in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rsquo; she cried sharply;
&lsquo;you must have dreamt it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I did dream&mdash;about you,&rsquo; he owned,
glancing at her; and once more that curious look of wondering joy
stole over his face.</p>
<p>Rosalie drew a little away from him in a displeasure which he
was quick to observe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will explain some day,&rsquo; he said, looking down
at her with a smile which disarmed her; and then, having reached
the bottom of the <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>hill, he chirruped to the horse, and they sped along
once more at an exhilarating pace.</p>
<p>By-and-by he began to talk about his uncle, speaking of him
with such evident affection that the heart of the future Mrs.
Sharpe warmed to him.&nbsp; Her grateful regard for Isaac had
increased during their four months&rsquo; betrothal.&nbsp;
Indeed, it could not have been otherwise: he was so placid, and
good-natured, and obliging.&nbsp; Moreover, he took a lot of
trouble off her hands, for he had assumed the management of the
farm immediately after their engagement.&nbsp; No one could cavil
at this arrangement: it was natural that the man who was so
shortly to be master should at once take over the control of
affairs.&nbsp; Even the gossips of the neighbourhood could make
no ill-natured comments; one and all, indeed, agreeing that it
was pretty behaviour on the part of the Widow Fiander to postpone
the wedding till after the year was out.</p>
<p>So Rosalie listened, well pleased, while Richard spoke of
Isaac&rsquo;s past generosity to him and his mother, of the high
esteem in which he held him, and of his desire to spend a few
weeks in his company before going out into the world afresh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I ought to tell him that I am <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>going to
marry his uncle,&rsquo; thought Rosalie, and then she dismissed
the notion.&nbsp; Let Isaac make the announcement himself; she
felt rather shy about it&mdash;and possibly Richard Marshall
might not like the idea.</p>
<p>She began to question him, instead, anent his past
achievements and future prospects, and heard with astonishment
and concern that the young man had not only failed to make his
fortune in the distant lands he had visited, but had come back in
some ways poorer than he had set out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only in some things, though,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I reckon I am richer on the whole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you poorer and how are you richer?&rsquo;
queried Rosalie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am poorer in pocket; my uncle sent me out with a nice
little sum to start me in life.&nbsp; Ah, as I tell you,
he&rsquo;s a first-rate old chap.&nbsp; He could n&rsquo;t have
done more for me if I had been his son.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s
gone long ago, but I have come back richer all the
same&mdash;rich in experience, for one thing.&nbsp; I have seen a
lot and learnt a lot.&nbsp; I educated myself out there in more
ways than one.&nbsp; Dear old Dorset holds a very fine place on
the map of England, yet &rsquo;t is but a tiny corner of the
world after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>As
she listened there came to Rosalie a sudden inexplicable
envy.&nbsp; She had never been out of her native county&mdash;she
had never wanted to travel beyond its borders, but for a moment
the thought struck her that it might be a fine and desirable
thing to see the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; she said tartly, for her irritation at
this discovery recoiled on its unsuspicious cause&mdash;&lsquo;I
wonder, Mr. Marshall, you should care to come back to Dorset
since you have such a poor opinion of it.&nbsp; Why did n&rsquo;t
you settle out there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out where?&rsquo; he inquired with a smile.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have tried to settle in a good many places.&nbsp; I was
in a newspaper office in New York&mdash;it was while I was there
that I did most in the way of educating myself&mdash;and then I
went to San Francisco, and then to Texas.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
pretty well over the States, in fact, and I&rsquo;ve been to
Mexico and Brazil and Canada.&nbsp; I might have done well in
several places if I could have made up my mind to stick to the
job in hand&mdash;but I could n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Something was
drawing me all the time&mdash;drawing me back to
England&mdash;drawing me home, so that at last I felt I must come
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what will you do now?&rsquo; she inquired with
curiosity.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he cried, drawing a deep breath,
&lsquo;I must work on a farm.&nbsp; The love for farm-work is in
my blood, I believe.&nbsp; I want the smell of the fresh-turned
earth; I want my arms to be tired heaving the sheaves into the
waggons; I want to lead out the horses early in the morning into
the dewy fields&mdash;I want, oh, many things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie considered him wonderingly: these things were done
around her every day as a matter of course, but how curiously the
man spoke of them, how unaccountable was that longing of which he
spoke!&nbsp; She had never seen anyone the least like him, and,
now that the conversation had drifted away from herself, she felt
a real pleasure and interest in listening to his talk.&nbsp; As
they drove onward through the gathering twilight she, too, was
moved to talk, and was charmed by his quick understanding and
ready response.&nbsp; Her own wits were quick enough, but she had
fallen into the habit of keeping her opinions on abstract
subjects to herself: the concrete was all that the people with
whom she associated were capable of discussing; and, indeed, they
had not much to say on any matter at any time.&nbsp; This young
bright personality was something so absolutely new to her, his
point <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>of
view so original and vigorous, and his sympathy so magnetic, that
Rosalie enjoyed her adventure as she had never enjoyed anything
in her life before.&nbsp; Her eyes shone, her cheeks flushed, her
merry laugh rang out; she felt that she, too, was young and
light-hearted, and that life and youth and gay companionship made
a very delightful combination.</p>
<p>As they drew near their destination a sudden silence fell
between them, and presently Richard broke it, speaking in a soft
and altered tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How familiar the country grows!&nbsp; Even in the dark
I recognise a friend at every turn.&nbsp; Is not that your house
yonder where the lights are glimmering?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rosalie, with a little unconscious
sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cornfield where I saw you lies just to the right of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would not talk in riddles,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, breathing rather quickly.&nbsp; Through the dusk he
could see the wrathful fire in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be angry,&rsquo; he said quickly; &lsquo;I meant
to tell you another time when I had come to know you better, but
after all why should I not tell you now?&nbsp; I saw a picture of
you in <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>London.&nbsp; I stayed a day or two there on my way
through from Liverpool&mdash;I had some business to do for a
friend in New York&mdash;and I went to the Academy, and there, in
the very first room, I saw your picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My picture!&rsquo; ejaculated she.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must
have been the one that London gentleman said he would
paint.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it was you&mdash;you yourself; and you were lying
in a cornfield under a shock of wheat, and the corner of your
house could just be seen in the distance, and some of the men
were reaping a little way off&mdash;but you were fast
asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie&rsquo;s heart was thumping in a most unusual way, and
her breath came so pantingly that she did not trust herself to
speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T was a big picture,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;full
of sunshine, and when I saw it&mdash;the whole thing&mdash;the
great field stretching away, and the men working, and the quiet
old house in the distance, and the girl sleeping so
placidly&mdash;it was all so glowing, and yet so peaceful and
homelike that my heart went out to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Dorset,&rdquo; I said, and I believe I cried&mdash;I know I felt
as if I could cry.&nbsp; After all those years of wandering to
find, when I thought myself all alone in a great strange <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>city, that
piece of home smiling at one&mdash;I tell you it made one feel
queer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie remained silent, angry with herself for the agitation
which had taken possession of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you see I was not quite so far wrong in saying that
to-day&rsquo;s meeting was a very strange one.&nbsp; The first
instant my eyes fell upon you I recognised you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt she must say something, but her voice sounded husky
and quite unlike itself when she spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It certainly was odd that we should come across each
other near Dorchester.&nbsp; It would of course have been quite
natural if you had recognised me when you came to your
uncle&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would have been more interested in my
story,&rsquo; he said reproachfully, after a pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am&mdash;I am very much interested; I think it a very
funny story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Funny!&rsquo; he repeated, and then relapsed into
silence, which remained unbroken until they turned in at
Rosalie&rsquo;s gate.</p>
<h3><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<blockquote><p>A thousand thorns, and briers, and stings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have in my poor breast;<br />
Yet ne&rsquo;er can see that salve which brings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My passion any rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Herrick</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, my boy, I be main glad
you be come back.&nbsp; There bain&rsquo;t no place like home, be
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Isaac Sharpe repeated these words for the twentieth time
since his nephew&rsquo;s arrival, he beamed affectionately upon
him through the fragrant steam of the bowl of punch specially
brewed in his honour, and then, leaning back in his chair, sighed
and shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye be wonderful like your mother, Richard,&rsquo; he
said, and sighed again, and groaned, and took another sip of
punch, blinking the while, partly from the strength of the
decoction and partly because he was overcome by emotion.</p>
<p>Richard, sitting opposite to him, stretched out his legs
luxuriously to the warmth of the crackling wood fire, and,
removing his pipe <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>from his lips, gazed contentedly round the familiar
kitchen, which was now looking its best in the homely
radiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is good to come back to the dear old place and to
find everything exactly the same as ever.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
seem to have grown a day older, Uncle Isaac&mdash;nothing is
changed.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how delightful that
is.&nbsp; I had been tormenting myself during the journey with
fancying I should find things altered&mdash;but, thank Heaven,
they are not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He glanced brightly at the broad, rubicund face opposite to
him, and took his glass from the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your health, Uncle!&nbsp; May you live a thousand
years, and may you be the same at the end of them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He half emptied his glass, and set it down with a cheery
laugh.</p>
<p>Isaac drank slowly from his, peering meanwhile at his nephew
over the rim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my lad,&rsquo; he said, replacing it on the
table at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to you,
Richard.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is kindly meant, but changes, d&rsquo; ye
see&rsquo;&mdash;here he paused and coughed&mdash;&lsquo;changes,
Richard, is what must be looked for in this here
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His colour, always sufficiently ruddy, was <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>now so much
heightened, and his face assumed so curiously solemn an
expression, that Richard paused with his pipe half-way to his
lips and stared at him with amazement and gathering alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he said,
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are n&rsquo;t you feeling well?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re looking first-rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never felt better in my life,&rsquo; rejoined his uncle
in sepulchral tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, that&rsquo;s all right!&nbsp; You quite
frightened me.&nbsp; What do you mean by talking about
changes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac took a gulp from his tumbler and fixed his round eyes
dismally on the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There may be sich things as changes for the
better,&rsquo; he remarked, still in his deepest bass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t believe in &rsquo;em,&rsquo; cried Richard
gaily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re going to
turn Methody, or Salvationist, or anything of that kind.&nbsp; I
like you as you are&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want you to be any
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive, what notions the chap d&rsquo; take
in his head!&rsquo; ejaculated the farmer, relaxing into a
smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay now, I never thought on sich things; but
there&rsquo;ll be a change in this here house for all that, <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Richard.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo;&rsquo;&mdash;here
Isaac leaned forward, with a hand on either knee, and fixed his
eyes earnestly, almost tragically, on his nephew&mdash;&lsquo;I
be a-goin&rsquo;, Richard, for to change my state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He slowly resumed an upright position, drawing in his breath
through dilated nostrils.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I be a-goin&rsquo;, Richard,&rsquo; he continued,
observing the other&rsquo;s blank and uncomprehending
stare&mdash;&lsquo;I be a-goin&rsquo; to get married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me!&rsquo; exclaimed Richard, taken aback for a
moment; then rising from his chair he stepped up to his uncle,
and slapped him heartily on the back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well
done!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well done!&nbsp; I give you
joy!&nbsp; Upon my life I did n&rsquo;t think you had so much go
in you&mdash;you&rsquo;re a splendid old chap!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank &rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said Isaac, without much
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not agen
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I be against it?&rsquo; returned Richard
hilariously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a little surprised, because I
did n&rsquo;t think that was in your line; but, after all,
&ldquo;Marry in haste and repent at leisure,&rdquo; the saying
goes&mdash;your case is the reverse; you have taken your time
about marrying, so perhaps it will be all the better for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said the <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>bridegroom-elect, dolefully; adding, as Richard, still
laughing, resumed his seat, &lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d best tell
&rsquo;ee at once as there was goin&rsquo; to be a
change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, a change for the better, as you say,&rsquo;
cried the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be two to welcome me
when I pay the Down Farm a visit instead of one.&nbsp; I shall
find a jolly old aunt as well as a jolly old uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac took his pipe out of his mouth with a perturbed
expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She bain&rsquo;t so very old,&rsquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;of course not.&nbsp; Neither are you for
that matter.&nbsp; May she be an evergreen like
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank &rsquo;ee, Richard, thank &rsquo;ee.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m glad as you approve o&rsquo; my thinking on
matrimony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, matrimony&rsquo;s the best thing going,&rsquo;
said Richard, still gaily, yet with an undercurrent of something
curiously like tenderness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every grief is lessened
by half, and every joy is doubled.&nbsp; Always a bright cheery
face at the fireside, always a kind true hand in yours&mdash;a
woman&rsquo;s wit to point out where the man has been at
fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; interrupted his uncle, with a groan,
&lsquo;they be willin&rsquo; enough to do that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always ready to comfort you when you <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>are in
trouble,&rsquo; went on the young man without heeding him,
&lsquo;ready to advise you when you are in a difficulty&mdash;the
best of companions, the most faithful of friends, the kindest of
helpmates&mdash;that&rsquo;s a wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The farmer was gazing across at him with bewilderment mixed
with delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said, Richard,&mdash;very well said!&nbsp; Ye be
wonderful quick wi&rsquo; your tongue.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s the
way ye feel about wedlock you ought to be lookin&rsquo; out for a
wife o&rsquo; your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Uncle Isaac.&nbsp; Why, I have n&rsquo;t a
penny.&nbsp; I shall have hard work to keep myself to begin
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, we mid be able to manage summat.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a notion in my head.&nbsp; Ye be a-goin&rsquo; to take
up farm-work agen, ye tell me; well, an&rsquo; as I says to you:
Why not work on the farm where ye was brought up, and why not
take wage from your own flesh and blood instead of lookin&rsquo;
to strangers for &rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no one I should like to work for better
than you, Uncle Isaac&mdash;you know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do know it, Richard.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; know it very
well.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says you to me, &ldquo;I must have
somewheres to live,&rdquo; says you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Uncle Isaac!&nbsp; I say nothing <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>of the
kind,&rsquo; put in the young man hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
intended to remain a bachelor it would be a different matter,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not axing you to live wi&rsquo; me,&rsquo;
returned Isaac, throwing out his hand in a lordly manner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I was a-goin&rsquo; to keep single it &rsquo;ud come
nat&rsquo;ral enough, but my new missus&mdash;Well, &rsquo;t is
this way.&nbsp; She have got a house of her own, and she&rsquo;s
anxious for me to live over there along o&rsquo; her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Richard, looking rather astonished,
however.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, I were agen it at first, but I come round
to it arter.&nbsp; So I reckoned to let this here house to
somebody&mdash;one of the men, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps; but now has
you&rsquo;ve a-comed back, Richard, my boy, there bain&rsquo;t
nobody I&rsquo;d like to see livin&rsquo; here so much as
yourself.&nbsp; My notion &rsquo;ud be for you to settle down
wi&rsquo; a wife to do for you and keep the place tidy, and work
this here farm under me.&nbsp; My hands &rsquo;ull be pretty
full, and I&rsquo;ll be glad o&rsquo; your help.&nbsp;
<i>She&rsquo;s</i> got a biggish place to manage, and I&rsquo;ll
be glad to think as there&rsquo;s somebody here as I can rely
on.&nbsp; Well, what do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I say?&rsquo; cried Richard, stammering with
joy.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can I say?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to
thank you!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the farmer jovially;
&lsquo;and now, what about the missus?&nbsp; &rsquo;Ave &rsquo;ee
got your eye on anyone as &rsquo;ud suit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; began Richard eagerly; he paused, and then
continued laughingly, &lsquo;you must give me a little time, you
know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only been a few days in
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to think, my
lad, as you don&rsquo;t want to take a wife from abroad.&nbsp;
Nay, don&rsquo;t ye go travellin&rsquo; for a wife.&nbsp; Take my
word for &rsquo;t, the best is often to be picked up close at
hand.&nbsp; Not always, though,&rsquo; he continued,
reflectively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Elias Fiander&mdash;ye mind
&rsquo;Lias Fiander?&nbsp; He went travellin&rsquo; all the way
to Dorchester to buy a turmit-hoin&rsquo; machine, and it was
there, nigh upon eighteen miles off, as he come across his last
missus.&nbsp; But you know her,&rsquo; he went on with
animation&mdash;&lsquo;aye, now as I call it to mind, you were
a-tellin&rsquo; me how you drove her back to-day.&nbsp; Ah, sure,
so ye did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Richard quickly; &lsquo;yes, I told
you all about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, so ye did.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere funny how you come
across her.&nbsp; I be pleased to think as ye&rsquo;ve met.&nbsp;
She were a good missus to Elias&mdash;she were, indeed&mdash;and
a good missus to one man is like to be a good one to
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Richard caught his breath and leaned forward; his face
was flushed, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you say this to me now?&rsquo; he said
eagerly.</p>
<p>His uncle removed his pipe from his mouth, took a sip of
punch, and then looked at him solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, Richard, my boy, &rsquo;t is but nat&rsquo;ral
I should talk of her, seein&rsquo; as we be goin&rsquo; to be man
an&rsquo; wife so soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried Richard, almost
violently.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you talking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; returned Isaac, raising his voice to a kind
of mild roar, &lsquo;you have n&rsquo;t been listenin&rsquo; to
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a-talkin&rsquo; about Mrs.
Fiander&mdash;&rsquo;Lias&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo;
to get married to she!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; exclaimed his nephew in the same loud
fierce tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; bellowed Farmer Sharpe.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have n&rsquo;t I been a-tellin&rsquo; ye this hour and
more?&nbsp; Did n&rsquo;t I say I were a-goin&rsquo; to change my
state, and did n&rsquo;t I tell &rsquo;ee she&rsquo;d a house of
her own and wanted me to live over there along of her?&nbsp; But
your brains was wool-gatherin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lay a
shillin&rsquo; you was a-thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your own young
woman!&rsquo; cried Isaac, with <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>a roar of laughter, stretching
forward a long arm that he might give his nephew a facetious dig
on the nearest available portion of his person.</p>
<p>Richard laughed too, spasmodically, and with a wry face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a sly dog, Uncle Isaac,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re a cunning old
chap&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got your wits about you if mine have gone
astray!&nbsp; Yes, and you&rsquo;ve very good taste
too&mdash;you&rsquo;ve picked out the greatest beauty in
Dorset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except your young woman, eh?&rsquo; put in Isaac, with
a chuckle and another dig.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except my young woman, of course,&rsquo; agreed
Richard, laughing again with that odd contortion of the
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have n&rsquo;t found her yet, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My weddin&rsquo;-day is fixed for the end o&rsquo;
Ju&mdash;ly,&rsquo; said his uncle ruminatively.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have to look out for your missus afore that
time.&nbsp; I doubt as you and Bithey &rsquo;ud scarce get on so
very well&mdash;I&rsquo;m used to her, you see, but she&rsquo;s a
cranky old body, and it &rsquo;ud never do for ye to settle down
wi&rsquo;out a woman o&rsquo; some kind to do for
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; We might ha&rsquo; the two weddin&rsquo;s same
day: I&rsquo;d like to know as you was settled when I have to
shift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you kindly, uncle; you&rsquo;ve always <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>been like a
father to me, and I can&rsquo;t tell you how grateful I am to you
for the welcome you&rsquo;ve given me, and for wanting to do so
much for me.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know about settling down
after all&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been a rover so long, you see,
I&mdash;I might n&rsquo;t be able to stick to it and then you
might be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff an&rsquo; nonsense!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not hear
o&rsquo; no objections.&nbsp; Why, Richard, you never were one to
blow hot one minute and cold the next.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t half
an hour since you said there was naught you wished for so much as
to take up farm-work again and live on the old place&mdash;did
n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But nothin&rsquo;!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
a-wool-gatherin&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Your thoughts
is a-wanderin&rsquo; off to the new missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not that to be expected?&rsquo; returned his nephew
idly.</p>
<p>Resting his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he
leaned forward, gazing thoughtfully into the fire:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have n&rsquo;t got over my surprise at your piece of
news yet,&rsquo; he said, after a pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought
you so determined a bachelor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I thought myself,&rsquo; put in Isaac with a
nod.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&lsquo;And then&mdash;from what I&rsquo;ve seen of Mrs.
Fiander I should never have imagined that she would be the wife
you would choose when you did make up your mind to take
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; inquired Isaac, somewhat roughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s so young&mdash;forty years younger than
you, I should think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty-nine,&rsquo; corrected his uncle succinctly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she is so beautiful&mdash;so full of life, and
spirit, and dash.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine how you came to
think of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which Isaac meditatively smoked and
rubbed his knees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;I did n&rsquo;t
exactly think of it myself, ye see&mdash;but I could n&rsquo;t
someways find it in my heart to say No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To say what?&rsquo; cried the young man, dropping his
hands and whisking round in his chair.</p>
<p>Isaac gazed at him mildly, and continued to polish his
corduroys.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To say No,&rsquo; he repeated, slightly uplifting his
voice, and speaking very slowly and distinctly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
say I could n&rsquo;t find it i&rsquo; my &rsquo;eart
to&mdash;say&mdash;No&mdash;when she axed me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She asked you!&nbsp; Do you mean to say that the
proposal came from her?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>His
uncle nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T war n&rsquo;t very likely it &rsquo;ud
ha&rsquo; come fro&rsquo; me,&rsquo; he remarked
dispassionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;As I told her at the time, I never
was a marryin&rsquo; man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A silence ensued, during which Richard vainly endeavoured to
readjust his ideas.&nbsp; At length he said faintly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did she say to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said,&rsquo; returned Farmer Sharpe stolidly,
&lsquo;that it would n&rsquo;t be a bad thing for
me&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;t is a fine farm,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;and a good business.&nbsp; You could easy work the two
farms together,&rdquo; says she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard gazed at his uncle with starting eyes and a dropping
jaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why, in the name of Fortune?&rsquo; he
ejaculated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could understand her marrying
again&mdash;but why you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She knowed I&rsquo;d work the farm right, d&rsquo; ye
see?&nbsp; Things was goin&rsquo; wrong all round, and she knowed
I understood the work.&nbsp; Ah, I told her myself at the time
that she ought to look out for a younger man; but she says,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no counter-jumpers,&rdquo; says
she&mdash;meanin&rsquo; the Branston folks.&nbsp; Ah, there were
a good few after her, but she did n&rsquo;t fancy none o&rsquo;
them.&nbsp; She thought some was arter <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the money,
and none o&rsquo; them knowed anythin&rsquo; about
dairy-farmin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact,&rsquo; struck in Richard, rising from his
chair and beginning to pace hastily about the room, &lsquo;she
has proved herself to be a most practical woman.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t make away with her money&mdash;you won&rsquo;t allow
mismanagement of the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jist so,&rsquo; agreed his uncle, sucking vigorously at
his partially extinguished pipe.</p>
<p>Richard continued to walk about the room, and presently paused
opposite the hearth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she make an offer to Elias Fiander too?&rsquo; he
inquired sharply.</p>
<p>Isaac removed his pipe and stared up at him.&nbsp; The idea
was evidently presented to him for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He never telled me so,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
were made up in a hurry, to be sure.&nbsp; &rsquo;Lias had
n&rsquo;t no notion o&rsquo; sich a thing when he started off
from here.&nbsp; He went arter a turnip-hoer arter her
granfer&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; They sold &rsquo;en up, poor old
chap, and Rosalie&mdash;that&rsquo;s Mrs. Fiander&mdash;had
n&rsquo;t nowhere to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; remarked Richard sardonically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I think,&rsquo; pursued the farmer, averting his
eyes from his nephew&rsquo;s face and gazing stolidly at the
fire&mdash;&lsquo;I <i>think</i> &rsquo;twas &rsquo;Lias as <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>axed
her.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees, now I can mind he told me so at the
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me wantin&rsquo; a wife so bad,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;and her bein&rsquo; such a good hand at the
dairy-work, I thought I&rsquo;d make sure o&rsquo; her,&rdquo; he
says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told him, I suppose, that she was a good hand at
dairy-work,&rsquo; commented Marshall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I
understand the matter now.&nbsp; She is, as I say, a practical
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is&mdash;she is,&rsquo; agreed Farmer Sharpe
warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She be a wonderful good manager.&nbsp;
Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve said that.&nbsp; Ah, I reckon I
can say I&rsquo;m in luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard murmured something inarticulate and returned to his
chair, re-lighting his pipe and beginning to smoke without
further remark.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the hearth Isaac
ruminated contentedly, without appearing to notice his
nephew&rsquo;s preoccupation, and tumblers and pipes were emptied
in almost unbroken silence.</p>
<p>When Richard sought his room that night&mdash;the familiar
little attic-room which had been his in childhood&mdash;his first
act after a cursory glance of recognition and approval was to set
down his candle on the little deal table and to draw carefully
from his pocket a large envelope.&nbsp; Opening this, he took out
a <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>print,
evidently cut from some illustrated paper, or collection of
&lsquo;Pictures of the Year.&rsquo;&nbsp; Holding it close to the
light, he looked at it intently.&nbsp; Underneath were the words,
&lsquo;A Sleeping Beauty,&rsquo; followed by the artist&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; The picture represented a cornfield with a large
&lsquo;shock&rsquo; of sheaves to the front, beneath which lay
the outstretched figure of a girl asleep.&nbsp; Even in this
rough reproduction a certain likeness to Rosalie was discernible,
and Richard&rsquo;s fancy supplied the rest.&nbsp; Indeed, as he
gazed, he contemplated not only the glowing and highly-finished
work of art which had haunted him persistently since he had first
beheld it, but the vision of that afternoon&mdash;the exquisite
face, the lithe, graceful form which had suddenly appeared to him
against its background of bloom and sunlit green.&nbsp; He seemed
to hear again the blithe young voice which had thrilled him as it
prattled at his side; he seemed to see the large eyes lifted a
little shyly to his, and then modestly dropped because of his too
evident admiration.</p>
<p>He had deemed these things the outward indication of absolute
womanly perfection.&nbsp; His young imagination, fired by the
unexpected meeting with Rosalie, and further <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>stimulated
by his uncle&rsquo;s chance remarks, had created a marvellous
romance before Isaac had pronounced the name of his own future
bride.&nbsp; Now the golden glow had vanished, all was flat, and
dull, and grey; and, what was worse, he knew his ideal to have
been delusive.&nbsp; Young bloom and beauty and fascination meant
nothing&mdash;Rosalie Fiander was a calculating, mercenary woman,
devoid even of feminine reticence.&nbsp; Not content with
&lsquo;setting her cap&rsquo;&mdash;odious phrase!&mdash;at the
man whom she considered best likely to protect her interests, she
had actually offered herself to him, haggled over the prospective
bargain, weighed with him the gains which must accrue to
both.&nbsp; When she was little more than a child she had angled
for old Elias Fiander.&nbsp; Well, she was homeless and penniless
then, and might from her extreme youth be supposed to know no
better, but now in the ripeness of her womanhood, with wealth,
liberty, all that she could desire, at her command, she must
needs sell herself again!&nbsp; Pah! such a nature must
positively be depraved.</p>
<p>With an impetuous movement he held the paper over the candle,
but as suddenly snatched it away again, extinguishing the <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>flame with
his finger and thumb, and rubbing the burnt edge ruefully:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This at least is a thing of beauty,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;why destroy it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, hastily restoring the print to its wrapper and thrusting
it into his pocket again, he muttered: &lsquo;I wish I had never
seen her.&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Isaac</span> was somewhat disappointed at
his nephew&rsquo;s lack of enthusiasm over a project which had at
first seemed to take his fancy so much.&nbsp; Talk as he might
about Richard&rsquo;s future, and his own desire that he should
pass the remainder of his days on the Down Farm, he could extract
nothing from the young man but vague expressions of gratitude,
and a doubtful promise to think the matter over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up yonder to
Fiander&rsquo;s,&rsquo; remarked Isaac, after breakfast;
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a little matter there as I must see
to.&nbsp; Ye mid as well step up along wi&rsquo; me,
Richard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking of taking a stroll round this
place,&rsquo; rejoined Richard.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s all your hurry?&nbsp; Ye may
as well wait till I am ready to go wi&rsquo; ye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
not be above two or three minutes at Littlecomb, and then we mid
walk round together.&nbsp; Besides, ye&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo;
to pay your respects to Mrs. Fiander, won&rsquo;t ye, arter
drivin&rsquo; her from Dorchester yesterday&mdash;and her
that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be your aunt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure: I must keep on good terms with my aunt,
must n&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Else perhaps she won&rsquo;t make me
welcome when I come to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No fear o&rsquo; that&mdash;she&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;ee
welcome enough.&nbsp; She al&rsquo;ays behaved uncommon civil and
respectful to I in &rsquo;Lias&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Ah, sure, that
she did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps she won&rsquo;t be pleased at my calling so
early?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Early!&nbsp; Dear heart alive!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
know that woman, Richard.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s astir soon arter four
in the morning, and she has her maids afoot afore that.&nbsp;
Aye, and the men knows if they comes late they&rsquo;ll get
fined.&nbsp; Ah, she be a wonderful manager.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, what in the name of wonder,&rsquo; said Richard
to himself, as he followed the portly white figure across the
yard and over the downs&mdash;&lsquo;what in the name of wonder
can she want with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Despite Farmer Sharpe&rsquo;s protest most people would
have considered the hour at which they betook themselves to call
at Littlecomb Farm a sufficiently early one.&nbsp; The dew lay
thick and sparkling upon the short herbage of the downs, and the
air was still sharp and keen.&nbsp; A lark was circling over
their heads, its jubilant notes piercing Richard&rsquo;s heart
with an odd sense of pain.&nbsp; What was this heaviness which
had come upon him, and which even the brisk walk through the
exhilarating air, and the delightfully familiar scents, and
sounds, and sights could not drive away?</p>
<p>Now they had entered Rosalie&rsquo;s demesne.&nbsp; These wide
fields were hers; yonder were her cattle grazing by the river;
and here, peeping through the trees and compassed about by a
goodly array of stacks, was her house with its bodyguard of
farm-buildings.</p>
<p>Richard, who had not spoken much throughout the walk, became
altogether silent as he crossed the well-kept yard, and even
lagged behind when his uncle approached the open milkhouse
door.&nbsp; Through this open door the sound of female voices
could be heard, raised, one in voluble excuse, another, whose
tone Richard recognised with a little shiver <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>of
inexplicable anguish, in vituperation.&nbsp; But Isaac Sharpe
boldly advanced into the building, and beckoned to him to
follow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter here?&rsquo; he inquired
good-humouredly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fine mornin&rsquo;, Mrs. F.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve brought my nevvy to see ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll find us rather in a mess, I&rsquo;m
afraid,&rsquo; returned Rosalie&rsquo;s clear voice, still with a
distinct note of sharpness in it; &lsquo;but I am very glad he
has come; I want to thank him for his kindness to me
yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peering over his uncle Richard descried the mistress of the
establishment stooping over the large cheese-vat already alluded
to, one white arm, bare almost to the shoulder, vigorously
kneading and stirring a huge mass of curds.&nbsp; Her buff print
dress appeared to imprison the sunshine, and attitude and
movement alike showed off her supple figure to the very best
advantage.</p>
<p>Most lovers, thought the young man, would have been unable to
resist the temptation of putting an arm about that inviting waist
for the morning greeting&mdash;the arm of the future husband had
surely a right to be there.&nbsp; But Isaac Sharpe stood bluff
and square in the doorway, his hands in his pockets, his hat on
his head.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse my shaking hands,&rsquo;
said Rosalie, looking up with eyes in which the angry light still
lingered, and a puckered brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything is upset,
and I can&rsquo;t leave the curds for a minute.&nbsp; Indeed, as
it is I fancy the whole of this batch will be good for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A hitherto imperceptible dimple peeped out near her lips when
she spoke&mdash;such red ripe lips!&nbsp; Such a bewitching
dimple!&nbsp; Isaac, however, merely thrust his hands a little
deeper into his pockets, and again inquired with increased
concern:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This morning I happened to be late,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, uplifting her voice, evidently for the benefit of the
culprit, Jane, who had suddenly melted into tears; a fact which
was betrayed by her heaving shoulders as she stood with her back
to the visitors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I happened to be a little late,&rsquo; repeated Rosalie
severely, &lsquo;so I desired one of the maids&rsquo;&mdash;here
Jane sniffed deprecatingly&mdash;&lsquo;to start work without
me.&nbsp; And when I came down, what do you think?&nbsp; I
actually found the careless girl pouring the rennet in out of the
bottle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tch, tch, tch!&rsquo; commented the farmer, clicking
his tongue commiseratingly.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>&lsquo;There were n&rsquo;t but a few spoonfuls
left,&rsquo; explained Jane, almost inarticulately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you possibly tell how many were left?&rsquo;
retorted her mistress, with increased acerbity.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know how particular I always am to measure it out drop for drop
almost&mdash;a spoonful too much may make all the
difference&mdash;particularly at this time of year.&nbsp; I call
it downright wicked of you to run the risk of spoiling the whole
vat-ful!&nbsp; There are a hundred and fifty gallons of milk in
this vat&mdash;it should make nearly a hundredweight of
cheese.&nbsp; And just because you are so idle and careless it
may all go to waste!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane turned her pretty tear-bedabbled face over her shoulder,
and inconsequently and incoherently protested that she always did
her best; then, with a gasp and a moan, she darted past the group
in the doorway and ran round the house.</p>
<p>Richard looked after her with a disgusted air, and then his
glance reverted to Mrs. Fiander, whose beautiful round arm was
still embedded in curds, and whose face, a little paler than its
wont, continued to be full of ire.&nbsp; What could this trifling
mistake matter after all to such a rich woman, a woman who would
soon be richer still?&nbsp; Besides <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>being cold-blooded and
self-interested, she was evidently miserly; she was, moreover,
distinctly bad-tempered.&nbsp; His imagination, already warped by
the revulsion of feeling consequent on his uncle&rsquo;s
disclosures, was ready to take alarm at every trivial
detail.&nbsp; Rosalie&rsquo;s pallor, and the slightly drawn look
on her face&mdash;both due in reality to a sleepless night,
resulting from an unaccountable perturbation of mind&mdash;were
immediately attributed to an acute and unreasonable
disappointment over an insignificant money loss.&nbsp; The eyes
which had gazed on Rosalie so ardently yesterday were now busily
tracing lines of fancied meanness in her face; those frowning
brows surely revealed the shrew, the compressed lips spoke of
parsimony.&nbsp; When that lovely colour faded, and those
clear-cut features had become coarsened by age and self-imposed
toil, what would remain?&nbsp; None of that beauty of soul which
he had thought to find there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; remarked Isaac placidly,
&lsquo;these accidents will happen, but I would n&rsquo;t advise
&rsquo;ee to be cast down by &rsquo;em.&nbsp; These here curds
d&rsquo; seem to be a-settin&rsquo; all right.&nbsp; I know how
&rsquo;t is wi&rsquo; young folks.&nbsp; A body has to stand over
them all the time.&nbsp; Why, when we be <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>a-shearin&rsquo; I d&rsquo; scarce dare go in for a bit
o dinner for fear o&rsquo; findin&rsquo; them poor ewes snipped
to pieces when I come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie jerked the mass of curds up with additional
impetuosity, but made no reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nevvy,&rsquo; pursued Isaac, &lsquo;thought
he&rsquo;d like to drop in an&rsquo; pay his respects to
&rsquo;ee, my dear, an&rsquo; inquire how you was a-feelin&rsquo;
arter the accident yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he nudged Richard as a tacit reproach for his
muteness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said the young man formally, &lsquo;that
you are none the worse for the shock, Mrs. Fiander?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The blue eyes shot up an inquiring glance, and the industrious
arm paused for a moment.&nbsp; What was the meaning of this
altered tone, and why was the gaze now bent on her fraught with
such cold disapproval?&nbsp; They had parted like old friends,
and she had looked forward more than she knew to their next
meeting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she returned, in a tone almost as
frigid as Richard&rsquo;s own; &lsquo;my nerves are not easily
upset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She believed the statement to be true; yet the equilibrium of
her system was at that moment, if she had but realised it, very
seriously disturbed.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&lsquo;Have &rsquo;ee sent for Nigger, Mrs. F.?&rsquo;
inquired Isaac.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sent James Bundy to look after him.&nbsp; He may not
be fit to move for a day or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, he were a good beast,&rsquo; remarked the farmer;
&lsquo;&rsquo;t is a pity ye did let &rsquo;en slip.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T was wi&rsquo; drivin&rsquo; fast down-hill, my nevvy
here d&rsquo; tell me, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;ve
never been used to.&nbsp; Ye should have druv &rsquo;en more
carefully, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie thought of the cause of her unusual haste on the
previous day; it was her anxiety to escape from the too evident
admiration of the grey eyes which were now bent on her with so
different an expression.&nbsp; The memory confused her; the
contrast stung her; she answered sharply, and with assumed
indifference:</p>
<p>&lsquo;One cannot crawl down every slope to suit the
convenience of a worn-out animal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He bain&rsquo;t worn-out, though,&rsquo; returned her
future husband, who invariably took things literally.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nay, I should say he&rsquo;d last a good few years yet,
though he be past &rsquo;ard work.&nbsp; &rsquo;Lias al&rsquo;ays
used &rsquo;en gentle; &rsquo;t is wonderful how far
that&rsquo;ll go both with man an&rsquo; beast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fair
an&rsquo; soft do go far in a day,&rdquo; the <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>sayin&rsquo; goes.&nbsp; Fair an&rsquo; soft&mdash;ah,
&rsquo;t is trew, &rsquo;t is trew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie bent her head over the vat in silence, her face
averted, so that her visitors could see only the outline of her
cheek, the exquisite curves of ear and neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair and soft,&rsquo; muttered Richard to
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fair and soft enough to look at, but her
heart is as the nether millstone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His uncle gazed reproachfully at him; he was proud of his
travelled and book-learned nephew, and had eagerly looked forward
to the impression he was sure to produce on &lsquo;Mrs.
F.,&rsquo; who had also been highly educated, and was considered
an authority on matters appertaining to culture&mdash;and he was
not showing off at all!&nbsp; He was standing there, mum-chance,
as stupid as any other body might be.&nbsp; He gave him another
admonitory nudge and remarked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard, that&rsquo;s my nevvy, did quite take me by
surprise last night.&nbsp; I was n&rsquo;t expectin&rsquo; to see
&rsquo;en at all.&nbsp; To tell the trewth I had no kind o&rsquo;
notion o&rsquo; where he mid be.&nbsp; He had n&rsquo;t
wrote&mdash;How long were it since you&rsquo;ve a-wrote me last,
Richard?&rsquo; inquired Isaac, driving home the query with his
elbow, and again frowning and winking.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; answered his nephew,
in muffled tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;A long time, I&rsquo;m afraid;
but, you see, you never wrote to me,&rsquo; he added with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That be different, my boy,&rsquo; returned the farmer
seriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was reasons why I did n&rsquo;t
write, Richard.&nbsp; I never was a writin&rsquo; man.&nbsp;
Lard, no,&rsquo;&mdash;and here he relaxed, and uttered a jolly
laugh,&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;t is as much as I can do to put my
name to a receipt, an&rsquo; then Bithey d&rsquo; do it for I,
and I do jist stick my mark under it.&nbsp; Nay, Richard, I never
was one for writing much&mdash;nay, I was n&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continued to roll his shoulders and to chuckle
&lsquo;nay&rsquo; meditatively at intervals, but his eyes were
meanwhile fixed appealingly upon the face of Richard, who
remained obstinately dumb.</p>
<p>Presently their hostess came to his assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose, now that you are here, you&rsquo;ll remain
some time, Mr. Marshall?&rsquo; she asked, without looking round;
her voice in consequence sounding nearly as muffled as the young
man&rsquo;s own as she bent over her cauldron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; Of course I want to
see as much as I can of my uncle, <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>but I&rsquo;m restless by nature,
and&mdash;and I never stay very long in one place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now,&rsquo; cried Isaac, in loud
remonstrance.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, ye be at it again, be ye?&nbsp;
Did n&rsquo;t we arguefy enough about it last night?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not take No, an&rsquo; so I tell &rsquo;ee!&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve a-comed home, and now ye may bide at home.&nbsp;
Lard, I did n&rsquo;t think ye could be sich a voolish
chap.&nbsp; What need have ye to go travellin&rsquo; the world
when ye have a good berth offered ye, an&rsquo; them that&rsquo;s
al&rsquo;ays been your friends ready an&rsquo; anxious to keep
ye?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Mrs. F. will tell &rsquo;ee the same as I
do, won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand what it is all
about,&rsquo; said Rosalie, pausing in her labours, however, and
straightening herself.</p>
<p>Why, &rsquo;t is this way,&rsquo; explained the farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When Richard come last night he says to me, says he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-longing for years an&rsquo; years to get
back to the wold place.&nbsp; An&rsquo; now,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; feel as if I could n&rsquo;t settle to naught
but the old work.&nbsp; Farm-work,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well then, this here house &rsquo;ull be empty afore very
long; an&rsquo;, moreover,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I shall need to
have somebody responsible to look after this place,&rdquo; for it
stands to reason, Mrs. F., as I can&rsquo;t be in two places at
one time.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>Rosalie endorsed this statement with an inarticulate
murmur, and he continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;since you want
to come back to the wold place an&rsquo; take up the farm-work,
why not live here and work for I?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not, indeed?&rsquo; said Rosalie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jist what I d&rsquo; say,&rsquo; said the farmer
indignantly; &lsquo;why not?&nbsp; First he were quite took
wi&rsquo; the notion, but arter a bit he did n&rsquo;t seem to
relish it.&nbsp; Now I want to know,&rsquo; pursued Isaac,
extending an aggrieved forefinger, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee relish it, Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose you should be disappointed in me&mdash;suppose
I should n&rsquo;t give you satisfaction?&rsquo; said Richard
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pooh! nonsense!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;ee know
fast enough if ye don&rsquo;t give satisfaction.&nbsp; Have
n&rsquo;t I brought &rsquo;ee up?&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t he much same
as a son to I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if&mdash;if I should find I could n&rsquo;t settle,
then you&rsquo;d be more vexed than if I had n&rsquo;t given in
to the plan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee settle, that&rsquo;s
what I want to know?&nbsp; Ax &rsquo;en that, Mrs. F., ax
&rsquo;en why he should n&rsquo;t settle?&nbsp;
Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee travelled enough?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said Rosalie, &lsquo;I should think
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>you
ought to be glad of a little quiet, Mr. Marshall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said!&rsquo; cried Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
&rsquo;en he&rsquo;ll be a fool if he lets my offer
slip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; repeated Rosalie, gazing in surprise
from the heated and excited countenance of the elder man to the
inscrutable one of his nephew&mdash;&lsquo;indeed I think Mr.
Marshall would be very unwise if he did not accept it.&nbsp; It
seems to me entirely to his advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of course,&rsquo; said Richard, with a momentary
gleam in his steel-grey eyes, &lsquo;of course my personal
advantage should outweigh every other consideration!&nbsp; It is
obvious.&nbsp; Nothing like a woman&rsquo;s clear head for
solving a difficulty.&nbsp; I will take your advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie&rsquo;s pretty face wore a look of such absolute
bewilderment, and she was evidently so much at a loss to account
for his sarcastic tone, that Richard suddenly burst out laughing;
the cloud lifted from his brow, giving place to an expression of
frank good-humour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Uncle Isaac,&rsquo; he cried,
clapping him heartily on the shoulder, &lsquo;forgive my chopping
and changing so often; this time my mind is made up.&nbsp; I
accept your offer.&nbsp; Shake hands on it!&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Richard Marshall</span> drove the plough
slowly up the brown slope, half turned at the summit, halted,
and, having established his horses at a comfortable angle, sat
down, with his back against a tall mossy bank sheltered by a
little copse, to eat his breakfast.</p>
<p>He had already partaken of a &lsquo;dew bit&rsquo; shortly
after dawn; but two or three hours&rsquo; exercise in the brisk
morning air had whetted <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>his appetite afresh, and he now fell
to work on his bread and bacon with the utmost zest and
relish.</p>
<p>The great field, all glittering green save for the brown strip
which testified to recent labours, stretched away for many goodly
acres.&nbsp; On a lesser slope beneath he could see the roofs of
Littlecomb Farm and its appurtenances, but the sight of the amber
and ruddy outlines awakened in him now no feeling of
repulsion.&nbsp; During the past weeks he had laughed himself out
of his whilom fancy for the fascinating and disappointing widow;
he had even taken himself to task somewhat severely for his
strictures on that unconscious young woman.&nbsp; Was it her
fault, after all, that her outer parts belied her real
self?&nbsp; Why had he been so unreasonably angry because she had
failed to correspond to the high estimate which he had formed on
slight and inadequate premises?&nbsp; She was a very beautiful
creature, and, no doubt, good enough in her way; if she was
common-place, and had a sharp eye for the main chance, she would
make the better wife to a practical farmer.&nbsp; He would in all
probability get on well enough with her when she became his aunt,
but meanwhile life was too full of <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>congenial work and ever-growing
interest to admit of his wasting time in improving his
acquaintance with the future Mrs. Sharpe.</p>
<p>He had thrown himself into his new pursuits with
characteristic energy, and found them daily more and more
engrossing.&nbsp; He possessed a gift not often to be met with in
the cultivator of the soil&mdash;a love of Nature for her own
sake&mdash;a sympathy with her moods, not from the practical, but
from the poetical standpoint.&nbsp; Clouds and sunlight, frosts
and dew, meant more to him than to his brother-toiler; the very
odour of the damp earth, the fragrance of the bursting buds in
copse and hedgerow, of the crushed herbage beneath his feet,
intoxicated him.&nbsp; The homely thud of the horses&rsquo; hoofs
as they trod the furrow, the ripping up of the green sod as he
drove the plough through it, the mere consciousness of his own
vigour and life and manhood dominating this solitude, filled him
with a kind of ecstasy.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is what I want,&rsquo;
he had said to himself over and over again that morning;
&lsquo;this is what I have always wanted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had finished his breakfast now, but he permitted himself
the luxury of repose for a few moments longer.&nbsp; He threw
himself back on the bank, his head resting on his clasped <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>hands, and
his eyes gazing up, up, through the interlacing boughs of the
trees, outlined now with shifting silver in the morning light,
through the ethereal leafage, still half unfolded, up to the
heights of delicate blue beyond.&nbsp; He had fancied that there
was not much breeze this morning; yet, as he lay thus quiet he
could hear a faint rustling in the undergrowth, and the
occasional crackling of twigs&mdash;a squirrel perhaps; but when
was a wood known to be absolutely still?&nbsp; Besides the
incidental noises attending the passage of living
things&mdash;flying, running, creeping&mdash;the creaking and
swaying of boughs, the fluttering of leaves, had not such places
a mysterious movement and vitality of their own?&nbsp; Was there
not always a stir, a whisper, in their midst produced by no
ostensible cause?</p>
<p>Smiling upwards, his head still pillowed on his hands, Richard
was meditating on some half-forgotten page of Thoreau which
seemed to bear upon this fancy of his, when suddenly a
woman&rsquo;s figure appeared on the crest of the bank close to
him, and without warning sprang down beside him.&nbsp; Rosalie
Fiander, with the skirt of her print gown gathered up so as to
form a receptacle for the mass of <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>primroses which she had been
gathering, and the fragrance of which was now wafted to
Richard&rsquo;s nostrils&mdash;Rosalie Fiander, with minute
dewdrops clinging to her dark hair, with morning roses on her
cheeks, and the morning light shining in her eyes&mdash;a vision
of grace and beauty, more captivating even than the glowing
pictured Rosalie of the cornfield or the stately heroine of
Yellowham Woods.</p>
<p>Richard sat up, the colour rushing over his sunburnt face; he
had divested himself of hat and coat, his waistcoat hung loosely
open, and his shirt was unfastened at the throat.&nbsp; For a
moment Rosalie did not identify him; then, as he slowly rose to
his feet, she too blushed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon; I did not know anyone was
here.&nbsp; I had a half-hour to spare before breakfast and ran
out to pick some primroses.&nbsp; This is my wood, you
know,&rsquo; she added hastily; &lsquo;I am not trespassing
unless when I take a short cut home across your uncle&rsquo;s
field.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ploughman Richard, with his bare brown arms and ruffled head,
was not at all alarming.&nbsp; She scarcely recognised in him the
trim, severe young man who had called on her ceremoniously a few
weeks before, still less <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>the mysterious personage who had
driven her home from Dorchester, who had said such strange
things, and looked at her so oddly&mdash;Isaac Sharpe&rsquo;s
nephew was just like anybody else after all.&nbsp; Being blithe
of heart this bright spring morning, she smiled on him
pleasantly, and, lowering the folds of her gown, displayed the
primroses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they not lovely?&nbsp; I like them better than any
other flower&mdash;in fact, I love them.&nbsp; Almost the first
thing that I can remember is holding on to my mother&rsquo;s
finger while she took me up to a bank of primroses; afterwards,
when I grew old enough to pick them for myself, oh, the delight,
each spring, of finding the first primrose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, curiously enough, the gay tone and easy manner had the
effect of filling Richard with wrath; the very grace of her
attitude, the child-like candour of her eyes were to him
obnoxious, the more so because he could not repress a momentary
thrill of admiration.&nbsp; He knew how much they were worth; he
knew the sordid nature beneath this attractive disguise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Primroses are fine things,&rsquo; he said, with assumed
carelessness.&nbsp; &lsquo;You should have picked some before the
nineteenth; then you would have had a good sale for
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to sell them,&rsquo;
cried she, her white teeth flashing out as she laughed, and the
dimples coming and going.&nbsp; &lsquo;I picked them for
myself&mdash;I shall fill every vase in the house.&nbsp;
Primroses should never be sold; those you see in the streets look
so miserable, all huddled together with their dear little faces
crushed and faded, and even their scent gone!&nbsp; It seems a
sin to sell primroses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, particularly as I don&rsquo;t suppose they fetch a
big price in the market.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had gathered up a bunch in one hand, and now raised it to
her soft cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are like satin,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Somehow the gesture and the smile which accompanied it
provoked Richard beyond endurance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are pretty little yellow things,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;but not worth the attention of practical people.&nbsp;
There are other yellow things more deserving of
admiration&mdash;rolls of beautiful fresh butter, for instance;
fine round cheeses!&mdash;The beauty of these is that they can be
exchanged for still finer yellow things&mdash;golden coin, Mrs.
Fiander, that is the only yellow thing really worth thinking
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you so fond of money?&rsquo; she asked innocently;
and once more she laid the <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>dew-drenched flowers caressingly
against her cheek.&nbsp; How could she look so guileless; how had
she the face to turn the tables on him thus; above all, how dared
she be so beautiful!&nbsp; He had almost succeeded in forgetting
his transitory hallucination; he wanted to ignore her
charm&mdash;and here she was tantalising him afresh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we not all fond of money?&rsquo; he said, with a
forced laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are not you fond of money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; queried she; and the blue eyes glanced up
with genuine astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course you are!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all fond of
it, I say.&nbsp; We men toil for it: we sell our brains for
it&mdash;we sell our strength and power, and the best years of
our lives for it.&nbsp; And you women&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused.&nbsp; Rosalie, surprised at his vehemence, but
still half amused, inquired lightly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do we do?&nbsp; Take care of it when
we&rsquo;ve got it, and do without it when we have
n&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not always,&rsquo; he added; and this time there was no
mistaking the deliberate insolence of his tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sometimes a woman sells herself when she has n&rsquo;t got
it, and sometimes, mistrusting her own powers of management, she
invites other people to take care of it for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>There
was a dead silence for a moment.&nbsp; Richard, fixing his
merciless gaze upon her face, saw the colour ebb from it, leaving
the very lips white.&nbsp; His shot had struck home&mdash;he was
glad of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Rosalie at last, lifting
her eyes, which she had involuntarily lowered, and looking at him
steadily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you must know what I mean,&rsquo; he returned,
with a smile almost insulting in its contemptuousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you attack me?&rsquo; she inquired, without
flinching, though her large eyes looked pathetic in their
surprise and pain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I attacking you?&nbsp; I am merely stating
facts.&nbsp; When a penniless young girl marries a prosperous old
man one is bound to conclude that his money is the chief
attraction, and when that same girl, finding herself a few years
later rich and free, offers herself for the second time to a man
forty years older than herself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offers herself?&rsquo; cried Rosalie, turning upon him
fiercely while the blood returned impetuously to her face;
&lsquo;how dare you say such an insulting thing to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not true?&rsquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
the statement on most excellent authority.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>Rosalie dropped her flower-laden skirt, a yellow shower
falling at her feet, and buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she groaned, &lsquo;Isaac told you
that!&nbsp; He&mdash;he said&mdash;oh, how could he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful shoulders heaved, tears trickled through her
fingers, but Richard steeled his heart against her.&nbsp; Let her
suffer&mdash;let her cry!&nbsp; These selfish tears could not
expiate the things that she had done.&nbsp; Tears and subterfuges
were woman&rsquo;s natural weapons, but they should not avail
her.&nbsp; She should be made to realise her own vileness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you deny it?&rsquo; he said sternly.</p>
<p>Rosalie dropped her hands, and raised her head: her lip was
still quivering, but her eyes shone through the tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I deny nothing,&rsquo; she said; and without another
word walked away from him, down the slope, and across the field,
passing through a gate at the further end.</p>
<p>Richard stood looking after her until she was out of sight;
then his eyes reverted to the heap of primroses lying at his
feet&mdash;a tumbled heap, sweet, and dewy, and fresh&mdash;just
as they had fallen from her gown.</p>
<p>Mechanically he stooped and began to <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>gather them
together, but presently he threw back again the flowers he had
picked up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should I do with them?&rsquo; he murmured, half
aloud.&nbsp; Straightening himself he passed his hand across his
brow, and looked round him with a blank stare.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
have I done?&rsquo; he said.</p>

O&rsquo;er which I heard her velvet footfall come;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Ye</span> bain&rsquo;t sich very
good company to-night, Richard,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Sharpe,
laying down his knife and fork, and gazing critically at his
nephew.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, I can&rsquo;t say as ye be.&nbsp; You
have n&rsquo;t opened your mouth since we sat down, except just
to put a bit into it now and again, and not too often
neither.&nbsp; Ye bain&rsquo;t eatin&rsquo; nothing to speak on,
an&rsquo; ye have n&rsquo;t a word to throw to a dog.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s amiss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;nothing,&rsquo; returned Richard, rousing
himself with a startled look from the brown study into which he
had fallen.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose I am tired,&rsquo; he added,
as an afterthought.</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&lsquo;Ah, very like ye be,&rsquo; agreed the farmer
commiseratingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It just depends on what a
man&rsquo;s used to how soon he gets knocked up.&nbsp; You be
used to town, an&rsquo; travellin&rsquo;, and that, and when you
come back to the ploughin&rsquo; it tries you a bit to start
wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is just the other way wi&rsquo; I;
I&rsquo;m used to the country, d&rsquo; ye see, and when I do
have to go to town&mdash;to Dorchester, or Weymouth, or any big
place like that&mdash;Lard, I do get mortal tired!&nbsp;
Walkin&rsquo; them streets, now, and lookin&rsquo; in at the
shop-winders&mdash;dear heart alive, it makes me so weary as I
could very nigh drop down in the middle of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; As
for travellin&rsquo;&mdash;goin&rsquo; in trains an&rsquo;
sich-like&mdash;it do make me so stiff I can scarce lay legs to
the ground when I do &rsquo;light from &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I
dare say you found it a hardish bit o&rsquo; work turnin&rsquo;
up the big field yonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His nephew made no response, and Isaac bawled out the question
afresh.</p>
<p>The young man, who had been absently balancing a fork on his
fore-finger, started, and replied hastily that he had n&rsquo;t
found it at all hard&mdash;at least&mdash;yes, perhaps rather
hard, but very pleasant; and he liked the work.</p>
<p>Isaac took a farewell pull at his pint mug, set it down, and
pushed his plate away.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>&lsquo;Draw up to the fire, lad,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and smoke your pipe quick, and then turn in&mdash;ye
bain&rsquo;t fit for nothin&rsquo; but bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; returned Richard hastily, as he rose,
&lsquo;I could not go to bed yet&mdash;it is not much past
eight.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll sit down by the
fire&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go out for a stroll to stretch my
legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stretch your legs!&rsquo; commented his uncle
indignantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ye stretched them
enough to-day already?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a-worked hard enough
for two men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No remedy so good as a hair of the dog that bit you,
you know,&rsquo; said Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;A brisk turn will
take the stiffness off, and it is a lovely evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, how restless these young chaps do be!&rsquo;
ejaculated Isaac, as he scraped his chair across the tiled floor
to the hearth; &lsquo;a body mid think he&rsquo;d be glad enough
to set down for a bit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll engage he&rsquo;ll find
it hard enough to turn out to-morrow morn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Richard had proceeded a little way he paused, and drew a
long breath; then, wheeling round swiftly, began to retrace his
steps, brought himself to a stand-still for the second time, his
hands clenched, his eyes fixed; finally, crying aloud: &lsquo;I
will do it&mdash;I must do <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>it!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned once
more, and pursued his former course.</p>
<p>The sun had set some time before, but the heavens were still
luminous; the rosy glow which lingered at the horizon merging
into soft primrose, which in its turn melted into an exquisite
ethereal green.&nbsp; Against this lambent background the hills
and woods stood out darkly purple, while the little copses
scattered here and there upon the downs, and the hedge at the
further end, appeared to be almost black.&nbsp; Little parties of
his uncle&rsquo;s sheep scurried out of Richard&rsquo;s way, a
bell tinkling here and there among them; birds flew almost into
his face as he passed the groups of trees before alluded to; when
he forced his way through the hedge a trailing tendril of
honeysuckle, wet with the heavy dew, flapped against his face;
every now and then a rabbit crossed his path, its passage
scarcely noticeable in the dusk save for the flash of its little
white tail.&nbsp; There must have been thyme growing on or about
those downs, for its fragrance was strong in the air.&nbsp;
Richard did not, however, pause to inhale it&mdash;it is even
doubtful if he noticed it; yet, when by-and-by entering
Rosalie&rsquo;s fields he skirted a bank overgrown with
primroses, their perfume for a moment turned him almost
faint.</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Here
was the house at last&mdash;how quiet at this hour!&nbsp; Nothing
seemed to be stirring; no one was about.</p>
<p>Susan appeared in answer to a somewhat tremulous knock, and
informed him that her mistress was in the garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon call her,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he returned quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will
go to her&mdash;I only want to see her for a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Who knew?&nbsp; She might refuse to obey the summons; it was
best to come upon her without warning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Round to the left,&rsquo; explained Susan; &lsquo;the
path leads you up to the gate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following her directions, and passing through the little
wicket, Richard presently found himself in the walled enclosure
which had once been the Manor House garden, for Littlecomb had
been the dower house of a noble family; along the straight prim
paths stately ladies had loved to pace, and the lavender hedge
which was Rosalie&rsquo;s pride had been the pride of many a
titled dame before her.&nbsp; It was more of a pleasant
wilderness than a garden now, having been neglected by Elias and
his predecessors on the farm; but Rosalie was endeavouring to
reclaim it, and <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>already had made progress with the work.&nbsp; Richard,
walking slowly onward, glanced anxiously down the dim alleys, and
peered into various overgrown bowers.&nbsp; At length, amid a
mass of distant greenery, he descried a moving figure, and,
quickening his pace, advanced towards it.&nbsp; The afterglow had
now almost faded, and the moon had not yet risen; here beneath
these high walls and amid this dense growth everything looked
shadowy and unreal.</p>
<p>He would scarcely have distinguished which was path and which
was flower-border had he not been guided towards the spot where
she stood by a double line of white pinks.&nbsp; Now a
blossom-laden apple-bough barred his progress; now he passed
beneath an arch of monthly roses, brushing off the moisture from
leaf and bloom as he went.</p>
<p>All at once Rosalie&rsquo;s voice called through the dusk:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that you, Susan?&nbsp; Come here for a moment; I
want you to hold this branch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard made no reply, but hastened on.&nbsp; The shadowy
figure turned, and he saw the pale silhouette of her face.&nbsp;
She was standing beneath a great bush laden with white blossoms,
which from their size and perfume he judged to be lilac; she had
drawn down a <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>branch and was endeavouring to detach one of the
clustering blooms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; he returned.</p>
<p>She loosed the branch, which flew rustling up to join its
fellows, and made a step forward; he could see her face more
clearly now; the gleam of her white teeth between her parted
lips; he even fancied that he could detect an angry sparkle in
her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you come here?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here at least I supposed myself safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came,&rsquo; replied Richard, in an unsteady voice,
&lsquo;to beg your pardon most humbly, most sincerely, for my
conduct to you to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was inexcusable,&rsquo; she said, after a
pause.&nbsp; It seemed to him that she was breathing
quickly&mdash;perhaps with a just and natural anger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not attempt to excuse it,&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot even understand it,&rsquo; she pursued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What had I done to you?&nbsp; How do my private concerns
affect you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, and then Richard said, almost in a
whisper:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can make no excuse&mdash;I think I must have been
mad!&nbsp; When I came to myself I felt&mdash;as if I could kill
myself for my brutality <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>to you.&nbsp; All day the shame of
it has been eating into my soul&mdash;I feel branded,
disgraced!&nbsp; I cannot rest until you tell me you have
forgiven me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was silence again, broken only by the faint warbling of
a thrush singing to his mate in the warm dusk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask a great deal,&rsquo; said Rosalie at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I scarcely know how I can forgive
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw the dark figure sway a little, but he spoke
quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can only say that I would give my life to recall
those insulting words of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Words!&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Words count
for little!&nbsp; That you should think of me thus&mdash;that you
should judge me so harshly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing; the thrush sang on, the liquid notes rising
and falling with almost unendurable sweetness.</p>
<p>Then, &lsquo;I entreat you!&rsquo; he pleaded once more.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I entreat you to forgive me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand in silence, and he took it without
a word; it was cold, very cold, and it trembled.</p>
<p>She drew it away almost as soon as his fingers had closed upon
it, and he turned and went away, his footsteps falling with <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>unaccustomed heaviness on the little path; and
presently the gate swung to behind him.</p>
<p>Isaac was sitting by the dying fire, a foot resting on either
hob, and surrounded by a haze of tobacco-smoke, when his nephew
entered.&nbsp; He looked towards Richard with an aggrieved
expression as he crossed the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, them there legs o&rsquo; yourn should be pretty
well stretched by now.&nbsp; I was wonderin&rsquo; whether you
were comin&rsquo; back at all to-night.&nbsp; Where have ye been
all this while?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard hesitated, and then, throwing back his head, answered
deliberately:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see Mrs. Fiander.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! to Littlecomb at this time o&rsquo; night!&nbsp;
What ever took &rsquo;ee there so late?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to tell you the truth, I went to make an apology
to Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; She came across the top field to-day when
I was ploughing, and I said something which hurt her
feelings&mdash;in fact, I offended her very much, and I felt I
could not rest to-night without begging her pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the farmer, and then paused, eyes and
mouth round with astonished concern.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he
continued presently, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad as ye
&rsquo;polygised.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very glad as ye <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&rsquo;polygised, Richard.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees, that was
very well done of &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; But what did you go for to
offend her for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward, anxious wrinkles still furrowing his brow,
and puckering up his mouth as though he was going to
whistle.&nbsp; By-and-by, indeed, he did actually whistle under
his breath and without any regard for tune.&nbsp; Richard,
meanwhile, stood looking down into the fire as though he had not
heard the question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; hinted his uncle at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think,
I&rsquo;m sure, how I came to forget myself so.&nbsp; I was out
of temper, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; commented the farmer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I
can say truly as she and me ha&rsquo; never had a word, not since
I knowed her.&nbsp; Nay, not so much as one word!&nbsp; We did
al&rsquo;ays get on wonderful well in &rsquo;Lias&rsquo; time,
and now I do really think as we gets on better than
ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you ought to,&rsquo; said Richard, a trifle
irritably; then he added in a softer tone: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe anyone could quarrel with you, Uncle Isaac.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, d&rsquo; ye see,&rsquo; explained Isaac, waving
his pipe impressively, &lsquo;even if I was a quarrelsome
man&mdash;which I bain&rsquo;t&mdash;I never should <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>ax to
quarrel wi&rsquo; she.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m oncommon fond o&rsquo;
Mrs. F.!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this Richard made no rejoinder.&nbsp; Stretching out his
foot he pushed the logs together, and then stood looking down at
them again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Richard, as ye should ha&rsquo; hurt
her feelings,&rsquo; went on the farmer, after ruminating for
some time in evident distress of mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, I be very
sorry for that, but ye could n&rsquo;t do no more nor
&rsquo;polygise; nay, ye could n&rsquo;t do more nor that.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m glad ye did &rsquo;polygise, Richard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Richard huskily; adding, with the
same irritation which he had previously displayed: &lsquo;Not
that it makes much difference one way or the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is a bad thing,&rsquo; went on the farmer,
&lsquo;for to hurt a woman&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s in the
beginning of acquaintance; it makes a bad start, d&rsquo; ye
see?&nbsp; It do rouse up notions as they&rsquo;d maybe never
ha&rsquo; thought on if they was n&rsquo;t crossed in the
beginning.&nbsp; Now my poor mother&mdash;your grandmother,
Richard&mdash;she did have sich tender feelin&rsquo;s there was
no livin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; house wi&rsquo; her.&nbsp; And my
father&mdash;ah, I&rsquo;ve heard &rsquo;en tell the tale many a
time&mdash;he did always set it down to his not havin&rsquo; been
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>careful
to keep the right side o&rsquo; her when they was
a-coortin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas this way, d&rsquo; ye
see?&nbsp; My father was a bit of a buck in his day, an&rsquo;
a&rsquo;most up to the time when he had his banns put up
wi&rsquo; my mother he liked to have his fling, d&rsquo;ye
see?&nbsp; He&rsquo;d walk o&rsquo; one Sunday wi&rsquo; one
maid, and the next maybe he&rsquo;d go along wi&rsquo; another;
and the third maybe he&rsquo;d go a-fishin&rsquo;, and
there&rsquo;d be my poor mother wi&rsquo; her best bonnet on all
the time a-lookin&rsquo; out for &rsquo;en so anxious.&nbsp; And
she got that upset in her feelin&rsquo;s, and that nervous, ye
know, that she was n&rsquo;t the better for it all her life
after.&nbsp; Ah, I&rsquo;ve heard my father say often when
she&rsquo;d scratched his face for him, or thrown his hat into
the wash-tub, &ldquo;&rsquo;T is my own fault,&rdquo; he &rsquo;d
say, &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t use to consider her feelin&rsquo;s as
a young &rsquo;un, and her feelin&rsquo;s is a-comin&rsquo; agen
me now.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac shook his head slowly over this affecting reminiscence,
and restored his pipe to its favourite corner.&nbsp; Richard said
nothing for a moment, but presently turned towards his uncle with
a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid, Uncle Isaac.&nbsp; Mrs.
Fiander&rsquo;s temper is perfect, I am sure.&nbsp; I was
entirely in fault to-day, and I will promise most faithfully not
to do anything <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>which might disturb your peace of mind in
future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though he spoke with assumed lightness, there was an earnest
look in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Sunday came round Isaac Sharpe
surprised his nephew by inviting him to accompany him on his
usual visit to Littlecomb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you want me,&rsquo; said Richard,
colouring and hesitating; &lsquo;I should only be in the
way.&nbsp; Two are company, and three are none, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now, &rsquo;t is a silly notion that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The more the merrier,&rdquo; I say.&nbsp; Besides, I have
particular reasons for wanting you to come to-day.&nbsp; You and
Mrs. F. have n&rsquo;t met since that night as ye
&rsquo;polygised, have ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Richard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I noticed you hung behind when I was talkin&rsquo;
to her arter church this mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Was &rsquo;ee
ashamed o&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rsquo; said Richard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but that will never do.&nbsp; If ye go on
a-hangin&rsquo; back, and a-keepin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; her way,
<a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>things
will get awk&rsquo;arder and awk&rsquo;arder a-tween ye.&nbsp;
Now, take my advice and come along wi&rsquo; I quite quiet and
nat&rsquo;ral; it&rsquo;ll all pass off so easy as ye could
wish.&nbsp; Just drop in same as myself.&nbsp; I want &rsquo;ee
to be friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t refuse if you put it like
that,&rsquo; said Marshall.&nbsp; And the two sallied forth
together.</p>
<p>In spite of Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s prognostication, there was
decidedly a little awkwardness about the young people&rsquo;s
meeting.&nbsp; Rosalie greeted Richard somewhat stiffly, and
invited him with formal politeness to take a seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T is a fine day,&rsquo; began Isaac, as he
installed himself in the high-backed elbow-chair which had now
become his by consecrated right.&nbsp; Rosalie responded hastily
that it was a very fine day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; remarked the farmer, with a covert note of
warning in his voice, &lsquo;my nevvy was a-sayin&rsquo; as we
come along that it was a wonderful fine day for the time o&rsquo;
year&mdash;did n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As it happened to be the time of year when fine days were not
uncommon, this alleged observation would not have testified to
any extraordinary perspicacity on Richard&rsquo;s part; but as a
matter of fact it was <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>entirely fictitious.&nbsp;
Nevertheless the young man did not repudiate it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, with his eyes on the floor;
&lsquo;yes, to be sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee find it oncommon warm in
church, Mrs. F.?&rsquo; pursued Mr. Sharpe, after a short
silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; agreed she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
longing for someone to open the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. F. d&rsquo; say,&rsquo; cried Isaac, turning to
his nephew with an explanatory bawl, which was intended to
stimulate him to further efforts at
conversation&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs. F. d&rsquo; say, Richard, as she
found it oncommon warm in church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s eyes travelled slowly from the carpet to his
uncle&rsquo;s face, where they rested; for the life of him he
could not muster courage to move them to the blooming face on the
other side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he commented faintly, &lsquo;did
she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; said Isaac emphatically; &lsquo;do
&rsquo;ee ax her&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he jerked his thumb
significantly in Rosalie&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
d&rsquo; say as she was a-wishin&rsquo; as somebody &rsquo;ud
open the door&mdash;did n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said Rosalie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, she&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;ee about that,
Richard,&rsquo; went on Isaac; and his enormous boot came <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>slowly
sliding across the floor till it reached Richard&rsquo;s foot,
which it proceeded to kick in an admonitory fashion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jist ax her about that&mdash;If ye&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; known
she was wantin&rsquo; the door open you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; opened
it fast enough for Mrs. F., would n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee,
Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; responded Marshall, with his eyes
still glued on his uncle&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you can jist talk about that,&rsquo; hinted the
latter, as he proceeded to search in his pocket for his pipe.</p>
<p>A dead silence ensued.&nbsp; Isaac looked from one to the
other, and the perspiration stood upon his brow.&nbsp; His
strenuous efforts had exhausted him, but the desired consummation
seemed just as far off as ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you got your tobacco-box, Uncle Isaac?&rsquo;
inquired the dutiful nephew presently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me give you a light,&rsquo; said Rosalie.</p>
<p>There they were again!&nbsp; What was the good of their
talking to him?&nbsp; He wanted them to talk to each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard,&rsquo; said Isaac, after sucking for a moment
at his pipe&mdash;when Rosalie applied the match a flash of
inspiration had come to him&mdash;&lsquo;Richard, my boy, ye have
n&rsquo;t been round this here farm since ye come home, have
&rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Richard; &lsquo;but I know it
well of old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but there&rsquo;s been improvement since ye
left&mdash;there&rsquo;s been a many improvements.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;d better take him round, Mrs. F., and show him all
what&rsquo;s been done the last few years.&nbsp; He be oncommon
fond o&rsquo; stretching his legs&mdash;Richard be&mdash;and
it&rsquo;ll just suit him&mdash;won&rsquo;t it,
Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard stammered confusedly that he should like it of all
things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you be a wonderful one for fresh air yourself, Mrs.
F.,&rsquo; went on the diplomatist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jist take
&rsquo;en out and show &rsquo;en everything, there&rsquo;s a good
soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie had risen willingly enough, for she had found the
previous constraint exceedingly uncomfortable; but she now paused
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are n&rsquo;t you coming, Mr. Sharpe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, my dear, I&rsquo;ll stay where I be.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T is very comfortable here i&rsquo; th&rsquo; chimney
corner, and I bain&rsquo;t so young as I was, d&rsquo; ye
see?&nbsp; Nay, you two young folks can go out and freshen
yourselves up a bit, and make acquaintance; and the wold man will
bide at home, and smoke his pipe, and be ready for tea when you
come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>He
nodded at them both with an air of finality, and twisted round
his chair so as to present to their gaze a large and inflexible
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, we had better start if we are to be back by
tea-time,&rsquo; said Rosalie, a little sharply; and Richard took
up his hat, and followed her out in silence.</p>
<p>The whole place was wrapped in Sabbath stillness; milking was
over, and a distant line of red and dappled cows was vanishing
down the lane, followed by one or two of the dairy
&lsquo;chaps,&rsquo; with white pinners protecting their Sunday
clothes.&nbsp; Save for the calves, which thrust their blunt,
moist noses through the bars of their enclosure, and the fowl
cackling lazily as they lay sunning themselves in the angle of
the barn, the barton was absolutely deserted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We drained the big mead four years ago,&rsquo; said
Rosalie, &lsquo;and threw the twenty-acre into it; &rsquo;t is
beautiful pasture now.&nbsp; Would you like to see it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard hurriedly expressed a desire to that effect, and the
two betook themselves in silence along a narrow farm-track to the
rear of the house, which led to the field in question.&nbsp; They
walked with the breadth of <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the lane between them, and in
unbroken silence; their eyes, by common accord, gazing straight
in front, and both secretly rebelling against the expedient which
Isaac had deemed so happily devised.&nbsp; At length they came to
a gate set in the hedge, and turned to look over it.&nbsp; A
great green expanse stretched away before their gaze, meeting the
sky-line on one side where it sloped upwards, and melting on the
other into the lighter, more delicate green of springing corn;
beyond were the woods, which, as well as the low line of hills
behind them, were covered by a gentle haze.</p>
<p>Richard leaned his elbows on the topmost rail of the gate, and
his face gradually cleared as his eyes roamed over the
landscape.</p>
<p>This county of Dorset has given birth to more than one great
writer of lowly origin, whose early nurture amid field, and
heath, and woodland has fostered an intimate and loving sympathy
with Nature, to which each in turn has given exquisite
expression.&nbsp; Richard Marshall, born of the same sturdy
peasant stock, brought up amid the same pastoral surroundings,
possessed a somewhat kindred spirit, though he was denied this
gift of expression.&nbsp; Yet the inglorious rustic <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>Milton was
not always mute; he had read so much, and meditated so much, and,
above all, felt so deeply, that at times something of what he
thought and felt struggled to his lips and found vent in words,
inadequate, indeed, but suggestive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How beautiful it all is!&rsquo; he said, turning to
Rosalie, with a very poet&rsquo;s rapture in his eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It seems to fill one like music.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I suppose you have seen far finer sights during
your travels,&rsquo; returned she, speaking naturally for the
first time, as she too leaned over the gate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finer things?&nbsp; Oh, yes, perhaps; but this homely
beauty touches me as no other sight could do.&nbsp; Something
about a great sketch of green like this always affects me
curiously.&nbsp; I love these wide fields.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I remember your saying so,&rsquo; said
Rosalie.&nbsp; The ice was broken now and she could talk to him
freely, even taking courage to broach a subject which had much
occupied her thoughts lately.&nbsp; &lsquo;You told me, you know,
how pleased you were at the sight of the cornfield in&mdash;in my
picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not turn towards her, and continued to scan the mead;
but over his brown face she saw the colour rush quickly.</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;of course I
remember telling you about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to ask you was&mdash;was the picture a very
large one; and was it well painted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very large indeed, and beautifully painted.&nbsp;
There was an iron railing in front of it because people pressed
round it so.&nbsp; I was told it was the picture of the
year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it?&rsquo; cried Rosalie; and at the note of
delight in her voice he turned and looked at her with a
smile.&nbsp; Her cheeks were pink with excitement, her eyes
shining.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she cried, with a sigh of
longing, &lsquo;I would give anything to see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a little print of it here,&rsquo; returned he
impulsively; &lsquo;I cut it out of a paper.&nbsp; It will give
you some idea of it, though of course a very poor one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another moment he partly withdrew from its enclosure the
print in question, holding the envelope firmly in his own hand,
however, so that the charred margin was hidden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See,&rsquo; he said, pointing with his disengaged hand,
&lsquo;there is your house&mdash;over there in the corner, and
here are your men, and here, under the piled-up sheaves, are
you.&nbsp; But of course the figure in the picture is far more
like you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it
must be a nice picture; and you say it is beautifully
done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is beautifully done.&nbsp; It is so real, so vivid,
that I felt as if I could walk into the picture.&nbsp; These
sheaves stand out so that one might think it easy to pass behind
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He glanced up as he said these words, and was surprised to see
Rosalie colour almost to the temples.&nbsp; His own heart gave a
sudden throb.&nbsp; Was it possible that she had divined the
audacious thought which had so often come to him as he recalled
that picture, and which, since his uncle&rsquo;s revelations, he
had resolutely striven to banish?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there did happen to be a certain
similarity between this thought of his and that which had caused
Rosalie to change colour.&nbsp; For there had flashed across her
mind the remembrance of the unknown artist&rsquo;s words:
&lsquo;Perhaps if I come across a very attractive specimen of a
rustic I may place him just behind the stook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the name underneath, I suppose?&rsquo; she said
hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the picture called?&nbsp; I cannot
see from here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is called &ldquo;A Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo;&rsquo;
returned Richard.</p>
<p>She was dumb for a moment, hot waves of <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>colour
rushing over brow and neck.&nbsp; What was it the man had said
last year?&nbsp; &lsquo;You will wake up some day, my
beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Words of ill omen!&nbsp; They had often
tantalised and tormented her, but now, as they recurred to her,
her heart seemed to stand still.&nbsp; Ashamed of her burning
face, on which the young man&rsquo;s eyes were now fixed, and of
the agitation which she could not master, she suddenly bent
forward confusedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the name of the painter?&nbsp; Let me
look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Richard could divine her intention she had snatched the
print from his hand, its black and jagged edges immediately
catching her eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; she said in an altered
tone&mdash;&lsquo;why, it is burnt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was now Richard&rsquo;s turn to look confused.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I began to burn it, but repented of my
intention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wanted to burn it,&rsquo; said Rosalie,
&lsquo;because you were so angry with me.&nbsp; Why were you so
angry with me?&nbsp; Was it because of&mdash;of what your uncle
told you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know he did not mean to do me harm,&rsquo; said
Rosalie tremulously, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>he&mdash;he
can have made you understand properly.&nbsp; Everything was going
wrong, and&mdash;and I was so much bothered; I found I could not
manage by myself, and he had been my poor Elias&rsquo;s
friend&rsquo;&mdash;she was beginning to sob now&mdash;&lsquo;and
I knew I could trust him not to do anything Elias would n&rsquo;t
have liked, and&mdash;oh, it is so difficult to
explain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray do not try to explain,&rsquo; said Richard very
gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you should n&rsquo;t misjudge me as you do,&rsquo;
cried she, and then burst into tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not misjudge you now,&rsquo; said Richard in a low
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&nbsp; I assure you I
understand.&nbsp; You have been quite right&mdash;quite right all
along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The big tearful blue eyes looked at him over the crumpled
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you said&mdash;you said I sold myself,&rsquo; she
gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;You should n&rsquo;t have said that!&nbsp; I
loved my husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you did,&rsquo; said Richard gravely and
tenderly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed I did.&nbsp; I loved him from the
first.&nbsp; He was like a father to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Richard, and he looked at her
with an odd mixture of wonder and compassion.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>&lsquo;He was just as kind and dotingly fond of me as
my own dear granfer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes; no
wonder you loved him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something in his tone caused Rosalie to pull down her
handkerchief and to cast a keen glance at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you look at me like that?&rsquo; she said
passionately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was I looking at you in any particular way?&rsquo;
returned he, averting his eyes quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you were.&nbsp; You were looking at me as if you
were sorry for me!&nbsp; How dare you be sorry for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you not telling me,&rsquo; he said quietly,
&lsquo;how much you felt the loss of your good old
husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know it was not that,&rsquo; she retorted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You looked at me as if I were a child who had no
sense&mdash;as if I did not know what I was saying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I?&rsquo; said Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg your
pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that what you really think of me?&rsquo; pursued
she, her eyes full of wrathful fire, though the tears were still
standing on her cheeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Answer me&mdash;I insist on
your answering me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s gaze had been fixed on the little <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>print which
she was holding, and Rosalie, marking this, had felt an increase
of indignation.&nbsp; Did he dare to share the opinion which the
artist had so impertinently pronounced?&nbsp; Rousing himself,
however, he turned towards her, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do think,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that you know very
little of life.&nbsp; Perhaps it is all the better for you.&nbsp;
The fruit of the tree of knowledge is nearly always
bitter&mdash;and sometimes it is poisonous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie was about to make a very angry rejoinder when the
sound of steps close to them made them both suddenly start; on
looking round they beheld a loving couple, such as are so
frequently to be met with in rural districts on Sunday
afternoons, sauntering down the lane.</p>
<p>Rosalie hastily restored her handkerchief to her pocket, and
again leaned over the gate, endeavouring to assume a careless
attitude; but she was secretly much annoyed, for the young man
who was so gallantly escorting a much befringed and beribboned
lady was no other than Sam Belbin.&nbsp; At any other time she
would have been somewhat amused on discovering how soon her lowly
admirer had consoled himself.&nbsp; He was working at <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Branston
now, and his companion was evidently a townswoman; but that he
should come on her just then, in the midst of her tears and
wrath, with Richard Marshall in such close proximity, was most
vexatious.</p>
<p>Sam stared hard as he approached, taking in, as Rosalie felt
though she did not again look towards him, every compromising
detail of the situation.&nbsp; When they had passed on he made
some facetious remark to the girl on whose arm he was hanging, to
which she responded by loud laughter.</p>
<p>The little incident impressed Rosalie disagreeably: she turned
to Richard petulantly, holding out the little print which had
been the cause of so much agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better finish burning this,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I had,&rsquo; returned he, with unexpected
docility.</p>
<p>Isaac looked so placid and cheery when they entered, and
greeted them with so bright a smile, that Rosalie was conscious
of a sudden rush of remorse.</p>
<p>Going up to him she placed her hand upon his shoulder, a
caress which astonished its recipient mightily, for he was not
accustomed to endearments from her.&nbsp; Rosalie kept her <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>hand there,
however, glancing defiantly at Richard the while, as though to
say, &lsquo;You are wrong in thinking me so ignorant; see how I
love and appreciate this good man;&rsquo; and Richard smiled back
kindly, as if replying, &lsquo;I see it, indeed, and I am glad
that you are content.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Isaac, squinting down sideways at
Rosalie&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, Mrs. F., did you take
&rsquo;en all over the place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I took Mr. Marshall to see the big mead,&rsquo;
returned she, a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sure he thought that improved.&nbsp;
Well, and then you took &rsquo;en up to see the root
crop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no, we did n&rsquo;t go there; we did
n&rsquo;t like to go too far, as you were here by
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I were all right.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here Isaac slowly
lifted the shoulder on which Rosalie&rsquo;s hand still lingered,
and again glanced down at it.&nbsp; As, taking the hint, she
withdrew it, he gently rubbed the place where it had rested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You took &rsquo;en down to the carnfield,
though,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll engage he
thought them oats was a-comin&rsquo; on wonderful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But they had not been to the cornfield, it appeared, nor yet
to see the potatoes, nor <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>round by the vegetable garden, nor
through the orchard; they had just been to the big mead and
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; commented Mr. Sharpe, gazing at them in
amazement, &lsquo;ye must ha&rsquo; walked oncommon
slow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We stood for some time looking at the view,&rsquo; said
Richard, seeing Rosalie somewhat confounded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lookin&rsquo; at the view, eh?&rsquo; echoed his
uncle.&nbsp; &lsquo;There bain&rsquo;t any view to speak on from
the mead.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; gone a bit further up
the lane and turned the corner ye&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had a
beautiful view o&rsquo; Branston.&nbsp; But if you enj&rsquo;yed
yourselves it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled round in his chair as he made this last remark, and
looked from one to the other of the young folks.&nbsp; Both faces
were alike downcast, and somewhat paler than usual.&nbsp; After a
moment&rsquo;s scrutiny Isaac became as crestfallen as they.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So long as you enj&rsquo;yed yourselves,&rsquo; he
repeated slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;So long as ye&rsquo;ve a-made
friends&mdash;I want &rsquo;ee to be friends, d&rsquo; ye
see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie and Richard glanced at each other.&nbsp; He read in
her face a kind of antagonism mingled with fear, and dropped his
eyes quickly lest they might betray the anguish <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>and longing
with which his heart was full to bursting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want &rsquo;ee to be friends, d&rsquo; ye see?&rsquo;
repeated the farmer anxiously and pleadingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s me and you, Mrs. F., as friendly as can be;
and there&rsquo;s you and me, Richard&mdash;you&rsquo;re much the
same&rsquo;s a son to me, bain&rsquo;t ye?&mdash;well, then
there&rsquo;s you and Mrs. F., why should n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be
friendly wi&rsquo; her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard, to whom the question was directed, remained
dumb.&nbsp; <i>Friends</i>!&nbsp; Could they ever be friends?</p>
<p>Rosalie, however, made a step forward and extended her
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should we not, indeed?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To tell you the truth, Isaac, we have done nothing but
quarrel since we first met each other, which was very silly and
unreasonable of us.&nbsp; Now, for your sake I am determined not
to quarrel any more; and for your sake, I think, he too should be
willing to keep the peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said!&rsquo; cried Isaac heartily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well said, Mrs. F.!&nbsp; Now, Richard, my boy,
where&rsquo;s your hand?&nbsp; Just catch hold o&rsquo; Mrs.
F.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&nbsp;
Shake it well!&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he thumped the arm of his chair
jubilantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be the best o&rsquo;
friends from this day <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>for&rsquo;ard!&nbsp; Here we be, we
three, friends all!&nbsp; Jist as me and poor &rsquo;Lias and
Mrs. F. was friends&mdash;dear heart alive! yes, we was friends
too&mdash;the best o&rsquo; friends!&nbsp; We was three then, and
we be three now, bain&rsquo;t us, Mrs. F.?&nbsp; We three!&nbsp;
I do mind a old song as your poor dear mother used to sing,
Richard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When shall we three meet agen?<br />
In starm, in zunshine, ar in rain!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lard, yes, she used to sing it, poor soul!&nbsp; Well, now we
be three agen, bain&rsquo;t us?&nbsp; Three good friends!&nbsp;
So, if you&rsquo;ll mix the usu&rsquo;l glass, Mrs. F.,
we&rsquo;ll drink to the bond o&rsquo; good
fellowship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; said Rosalie indistinctly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I forgot all about your glass, Isaac; I&rsquo;m so sorry;
I&rsquo;ll see to it at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She ran out of the room, glad to make her escape, and Richard
sat down near the hearth.</p>
<p>Friends!&nbsp; They were to be friends as his uncle, and
Elias, and Rosalie had once been friends!&nbsp; He had felt her
hand twitch in his as Isaac had spoken; to her the proposition
was doubtless as distasteful as to him it was impossible.&nbsp;
What was his uncle thinking of?&nbsp; There were some things
which flesh and blood&mdash;young flesh and blood&mdash;could not
<a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>brook,
and this triangular bond was one of them.&nbsp; But he would be
patient for a little while; he would choke down his rebellious
sense of injury.&nbsp; His secret, thank Heaven! was secure;
neither the guileless Isaac nor Rosalie herself had the faintest
idea of the miserable passion which he was striving so hard to
conquer.&nbsp; What was it she had said?&nbsp; They were to be
friends&mdash;friends for his uncle&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; His
uncle, to whom he owed everything&mdash;his kind, faithful,
generous old benefactor.&nbsp; Well, he would try.</p>
<p>That night, in the seclusion of his attic room, he once more
drew forth Rosalie&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sleep on, Beauty,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sleep on
in peace!&nbsp; I shall not try to wake you.&nbsp; Sleep soundly;
do not even dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, after a last silent look, he held it steadily in the
flame of the candle, watching its destruction unflinchingly until
the last feathery film dropped from his fingers.</p>
<h3><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</blockquote>
<p>For some time after Isaac&rsquo;s apparently successful
peace-making the friendly relations between the parties concerned
remained unbroken.&nbsp; Richard was frequently sent on messages
to Littlecomb, acquitting himself on these occasions in a
strictly business-like manner; and when he accompanied his uncle
thither he made such strenuous efforts to appear at his ease and
to entertain its hostess that Isaac was delighted beyond
measure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How th&rsquo; chap d&rsquo; talk!&rsquo; he would say
sometimes under his breath, with an admiring nod and wink.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bless me, he d&rsquo; talk like prent!&nbsp; I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low there is n&rsquo;t very much as my nevvy don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard, indeed, in his desire to avoid those terrible long
silences which had so much discomposed him during his first
visits to Littlecomb, <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>embarked upon wild flights of fancy,
related at length his past experiences, and delivered his opinion
upon men and things with a fluency which frequently surprised
himself.&nbsp; The fact was that he was afraid to pause; were he
to come to a halt when those blue eyes were fixed upon him, could
he ever take up the thread of his discourse again?&nbsp; Even as
it was, the mere consciousness of that intent gaze made him
sometimes falter; but, recovering himself, he would go on with a
rush, knowing that he was making many wild statements, but
persevering nevertheless.&nbsp; He was bound to do all the
talking, if talking there must be, for Rosalie was very silent,
and his uncle was at no time garrulous.</p>
<p>But the harmony of these relations was rudely broken by an
unexpected incident.</p>
<p>One warm afternoon, early in June, Farmer Sharpe chanced to be
standing by his own gate, gazing abstractedly up and down the
lane.&nbsp; Presently he descried an undersized, narrow-chested
figure making its way towards him, and, as it drew near,
recognised Mr. Samuel Cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fine evenin&rsquo;,&rsquo; remarked Isaac, nodding
sideways in his direction, and expecting him to pass on.</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>&lsquo;A very fine evening, Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; returned
Samuel, pausing, and leaning against the gatepost, with the
evident intention of entering into conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
very evenin&rsquo; for a quiet walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Walkin&rsquo; bain&rsquo;t much in my line,&rsquo;
returned Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, not without I&rsquo;m obliged
to&mdash;seein&rsquo; after the men and goin&rsquo; round the
fields, and across the downs to look after the sheep; but
walkin&rsquo;&mdash;meanin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; for a walk jist for
pleasure&mdash;it bain&rsquo;t in my line at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s in other people&rsquo;s line, though,&rsquo;
said Samuel; and he shot a cunning glance at the older man out of
his little red-rimmed eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I met your nephew
strolling up towards Littlecomb just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very like ye did,&rsquo; agreed Sharpe.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
do often go up there on business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucky chap!&rsquo; exclaimed Cross.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
rest of us don&rsquo;t often contrive to make business agree so
well with pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused to snigger, and Isaac turned his mild grey eyes
inquiringly upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Samuel Cross,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose as <i>you</i> do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The slight stress laid upon the personal pronoun appeared to
irritate the young gentleman, and he replied with a certain
acerbity:</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&lsquo;There is n&rsquo;t, as a rule, much pleasure to
be found in doing honest business, Mr. Sharpe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not among lawyers,&rsquo; said Isaac, nodding
placidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s others besides lawyers, though,&rsquo;
cried Samuel, &lsquo;as are n&rsquo;t so very honest!&nbsp; He!
he!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a very confiding man, Mr. Sharpe&mdash;a
very confiding uncle.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is n&rsquo;t everyone in
your situation that would care to make such a handsome young man
his business-manager where a handsome young woman was
concerned.&nbsp; He! he!&nbsp; Your nephew, no doubt, will do the
business thoroughly&mdash;perhaps a little too
thoroughly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nevvy,&rsquo; returned Isaac loftily, &lsquo;may be
trusted to do his dooty, Sam&rsquo;el.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is more nor
can be said for many folks as be all for pokin&rsquo; their noses
where they bain&rsquo;t wanted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cross&rsquo;s always sallow complexion assumed an even
more jaundiced hue as he retorted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most people do no business on Sunday&mdash;in England
they don&rsquo;t at least; but I suppose Mr. Richard Marshall has
brought foreign notions back with him.&nbsp; He was seen two or
three weeks ago doing <i>business</i> with Mrs. Fiander quite as
per usual.&nbsp; They were standin&rsquo; close together
lookin&rsquo; over a gate, just as if he and <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>she were
keepin&rsquo; company.&nbsp; And he was tellin&rsquo; her such
touchin&rsquo; business details that she was actually crying, Mr.
Sharpe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cryin&rsquo;!&rsquo; ejaculated Isaac, in a kind of
roar.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&nbsp; What had she to cry
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should I know?&nbsp; Because prices had gone down,
I suppose, since, according to you, they talk nothing but
business when they are together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, drop that,&rsquo; cried the farmer, losing patience
at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;What be you a-drivin&rsquo; at,
Sam&rsquo;el Cross, wi&rsquo; your hints?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; rejoined Samuel, thrusting his thumbs into
his waistcoat pockets&mdash;&lsquo;why, the remark as was passed
by the young man that saw them in the lane will perhaps throw
some light on the subject.&nbsp; Says he, &ldquo;I
believe,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as the widow Fiander be
a-takin&rsquo; on wi&rsquo; the new love before she is off
wi&rsquo; the old.&rdquo;&nbsp; So if I do drop a hint, Mr.
Sharpe&rsquo;&mdash;and Samuel assumed a virtuous air, and struck
an appropriate attitude&mdash;&lsquo;I do it in the way of
kindness.&nbsp; Take my advice and look sharp&mdash;look like
your name, sir!&nbsp; We lawyers see a deal of the world, a deal
of the wickedness of the world, and we know that worthy folks are
often caught <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>napping.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you be caught,
farmer&mdash;keep a good look-out, or your bride will be snapped
up from under your very nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Sam&rsquo;el
Cross,&rsquo; cried Isaac, who had been shifting from one foot to
the other during the latter part of the clerk&rsquo;s speech, and
was purple in the face with suppressed ire, &lsquo;since
you&rsquo;re so fond of advice maybe you&rsquo;ll take a bit from
me.&nbsp; Jist you keep that long tongue o&rsquo; yourn
quiet.&nbsp; What do ye mean, ye little treecherous spy, by
poking your nose into other people&rsquo;s business and
tryin&rsquo; to make mischief between them that&rsquo;s as good
as father and son?&nbsp; I know my nevvy a deal better than you
know him.&nbsp; My nevvy bain&rsquo;t a snapper, an&rsquo; so I
tell &rsquo;ee!&nbsp; Now you jist take yourself off out of this,
and don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee come here wi&rsquo; no more lyin&rsquo;
tales, else maybe ye&rsquo;ll find this here stick o&rsquo; mine
laid about your shoulders.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t so strong as I
were, but I could make a shift to hit &rsquo;ee a crack or
two&mdash;so now ye know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Samuel had started back as words and gestures grew
threatening, and now deemed it better to beat a retreat; turning,
however, at a safe distance to bestow a withering valedictory
smile upon his adversary, and to remark that he was sorry for
him.</p>
<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>Ever
since his rejection by Rosalie he had been burning with
resentment against her, and desirous of an opportunity of venting
it.&nbsp; A chance meeting with Sam Belbin had resulted in the
latter&rsquo;s imparting to him a highly-coloured version of the
scene which he had witnessed between Rosalie and Richard in the
lane.&nbsp; The desired opportunity seemed to have arrived, and
Samuel had hastened to take advantage of it, with, as has been
seen, indifferent success.&nbsp; As he now hastened away as
rapidly as his short legs would carry him he encountered the very
person he had been so anxious to traduce.&nbsp; Richard nodded,
and would have passed on, but that Cross, who was still suffering
from a redundancy of spite, thought the opportunity favourable
for venting it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are back already,&rsquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wonder you did n&rsquo;t contrive to be a bit longer
over your <i>business</i>!&nbsp; You would n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
been missed yonder.&nbsp; Your uncle seems quite content with
your doings.&nbsp; As I told him just now&mdash;he has a
confiding nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Richard, speaking in a
low even voice, but with an ominous flash of the eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! you know what I mean well enough, <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>you sly
young dog!&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, ask the fascinating young
widow&mdash;ask lovely, dainty Mrs. F.&nbsp; She knows what
she&rsquo;s about, though she contrives to look so demure.&nbsp;
Come,&rsquo; marking the expression of Richard&rsquo;s face,
&lsquo;you need n&rsquo;t turn rusty over it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell no tales, bless you!&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s others besides
me that has been passing remarks about the Widow Fiander&rsquo;s
new business-manager.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&mdash;You may carry on,
though, as far as I am concerned&mdash;perhaps I know a little
too much about the lady to envy you; she has played a double game
before now.&nbsp; As for the old man, <i>he&rsquo;ll</i> find out
nothing; he&rsquo;s as blind as a bat&mdash;as blind as a
bat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Cross thrust his tongue into his cheek, and made a
hideous contortion of countenance calculated to convey an
impression of his own extreme artfulness and of his contempt for
the old farmer&rsquo;s short-sightedness.</p>
<p>His own vision, perhaps, might with advantage have been a
little clearer; a man of quicker perceptions would have realised
that Richard&rsquo;s persistent silence was more fraught with
danger to him than a torrent of wrathful words.&nbsp; He was,
therefore, considerably surprised when Marshall suddenly brought
down his vigorous right hand upon the cheek at <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>that moment
distended by Samuel&rsquo;s malevolent tongue, and, before he had
time to spring backwards, the other palm inflicted similar
chastisement on its fellow.</p>
<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s clerk gasped, spluttered, and finally
uttered a choking howl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hang you!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made me nearly bite my
tongue off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serve you right if I had,&rsquo; cried Richard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You little reptile, if you so much as say another word of
this kind I&rsquo;ll half kill you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had seized Samuel by the shoulders and was now shaking him
slowly backwards and forwards:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you take back every word of your vile
slanders?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes,&rsquo; gasped Cross, in an agony
of terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you give me your word to keep that foul tongue of
yours quiet in future?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Lord, yes, Richard Marshall.&nbsp; For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake let me go!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve about half
killed me as it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard released him with a parting admonition to look out,
and Cross went on his way with a staggering gait, and stuffing
his pocket-handkerchief into his mouth.</p>
<p>Richard, still in a white heat of passion, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>was
striding along at a tremendous rate, when he suddenly observed
the large white-clad person of his uncle standing contemplatively
some twenty yards away from the scene of the encounter.&nbsp; His
good humoured face wore a pleasant and satisfied smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, lad!&rsquo; he remarked, as soon as Richard
came within hearing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye did give it &rsquo;en in
style!&nbsp; I never did see nothing more neat.&nbsp; I do rather
think, Richard, as Mr. Sam&rsquo;el Cross &rsquo;ull have the
toothache.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only wish I had made every bone in his body
ache!&rsquo; cried Richard, still fuming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low as he said something as
ann&rsquo;yed &rsquo;ee, Richard,&rsquo; said the farmer, ceasing
his placid chuckles and looking intently at his nephew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned Richard, &lsquo;he annoyed me very
much.&nbsp; He&mdash;in point of fact, he insulted me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; commented Isaac, &lsquo;that was
strange.&nbsp; I did n&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d insult &rsquo;ee
to your face, Richard.&nbsp; He was a-talkin&rsquo; to me jist
now, and he did say some very insultin&rsquo; things agen
you&mdash;but that was behind your back, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp; I
did n&rsquo;t think the chap would acshally go for to say
&rsquo;em to your face.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&lsquo;What did he say of me?&rsquo; said Richard
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he did say redic&rsquo;lous things about you and
Mrs. F.&nbsp; Ah, the little raskil could n&rsquo;t so much as
leave Mrs. F.&rsquo;s name out!&nbsp; And he were very oncivil to
me&mdash;ye &rsquo;d scarce believe how oncivil he were.&nbsp; Up
and told me straight out as if I did n&rsquo;t look out
you&rsquo;d be snappin&rsquo; up Mrs. F. without &ldquo;By your
leave,&rdquo; or &ldquo;With your leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I give
it &rsquo;en back well, I can tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Says I,
&ldquo;My nevvy bain&rsquo;t a snapper,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; Them
was my very words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye little treecherous spy,&rdquo;
I says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be a-pokin&rsquo; your nose
into other folks&rsquo; business.&nbsp; I know my nevvy,&rdquo; I
says, &ldquo;and my nevvy bain&rsquo;t a
snapper.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Isaac paused to chuckle jubilantly, and, turning, slapped
his nephew jovially on the back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of that for an answer, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that it was an excellent one,&rsquo; said Richard,
beginning to stride on again so rapidly that his uncle could
scarcely keep pace with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I told him too,&rsquo; pursued the latter,
&lsquo;that if he came agen with sich lyin&rsquo; tales I&rsquo;d
lay my stick about his shoulders.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said that,&rsquo; exclaimed
the young man without turning his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
glad you told him they were lying tales.&nbsp; They <i>are</i>
lying tales!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the stick,&rsquo; Isaac reminded him with modest
triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon I brought it in rather neat about
the stick.&nbsp; Says I, &ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t quite so young as
I were, but I could make shift to hit &rsquo;ee a crack or two
yet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I had thrashed him within an inch of his
life!&rsquo; came the savage comment thrown over Richard&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, Richard, how you do lay them long legs o&rsquo;
yourn to the ground,&rsquo; panted Isaac, pausing to wipe his
brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fair out o&rsquo; breath.&nbsp; Bide
a bit&mdash;bide a bit; let me blow.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee be in sich a takin&rsquo;, lad.&nbsp; I reckon them
there little taps as ye gave Sam&rsquo;el Cross &rsquo;ull keep
&rsquo;en quiet for some time.&nbsp; He be gone t&rsquo;other
way, anyhow; and it won&rsquo;t do &rsquo;ee no good to run me
off my legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard came slowly back; his face was fixed and stern, but he
spoke more quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle, I blame myself to a certain extent for what has
happened.&nbsp; I might have guessed that in a gossiping little
place like this people would talk if I went so often to
Littlecomb.&nbsp; I must keep away altogether for the
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>&lsquo;Nay now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee let yourself get
so upset.&nbsp; What signifies a bit of idle chatter!&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t need to take no notice of it at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I will take notice of it,&rsquo; cried
Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t choose that people should
take liberties with my name; and what is worse&mdash;with
hers.&nbsp; I need not assure you, Uncle Isaac, that I have never
said one word to Mrs. Fiander that anyone need find fault
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; agreed Isaac, &lsquo;of course
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; He came to a sudden pause, however, and cast a
sidelong look at his nephew, scratching his jaw
meditatively.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was one day&mdash;one
Sunday&mdash;Sam&rsquo;el Cross was a-sayin&rsquo;, somebody seed
you both standin&rsquo; a-lookin&rsquo; over a gate, and Mrs. F.
was a-cryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; That was n&rsquo;t very likely, I
don&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was n&rsquo;t very likely as
you&rsquo;d say aught as &rsquo;ud make Mrs. F. cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard drew a quick breath, and his hands involuntarily
clenched themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did cry one day,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was the first Sunday you took me to Littlecomb.&nbsp; She
imagined&rsquo;&mdash;hesitatingly&mdash;&lsquo;that I had a bad
opinion of her, and she cried, and said I was unjust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll be the day you went to see the big <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>mead,&rsquo; said Farmer Sharpe reflectively.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ye had n&rsquo;t made friends then.&nbsp; Ye have
n&rsquo;t made her cry since, Richard, have &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Women be so fanciful.&nbsp; Ye did n&rsquo;t really
have a bad opinion of her, Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Far from it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She be a very dear woman&mdash;a very dear woman.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T is n&rsquo;t very likely as anybody &rsquo;ud have a bad
opinion of Mrs. F.&nbsp; Well, ye be real trew friends now, and
ye don&rsquo;t need to take no notice of idle talk.&nbsp; Let
there be no coolness between ye on that account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard, however, remained fixed in his determination to avoid
Littlecomb for the future, and in spite of his uncle&rsquo;s
protests adhered to his resolution.&nbsp; On the following Sunday
he was somewhat discomposed to find Rosalie&rsquo;s eyes straying
towards him once or twice as he knelt on the opposite side of the
church, and it seemed to him that they wore a questioning,
pleading expression.</p>
<p>His purpose, however, remained unshaken, and immediately after
the early dinner he went out without saying anything to his
uncle, and could not be found when the hour came for their weekly
pilgrimage to Littlecomb.&nbsp; After waiting some time, and
vainly <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>bellowing his name, the farmer was obliged to go
without him.</p>
<p>Richard was in a very taciturn mode at the evening meal, and
his uncle&rsquo;s announcement that Mrs. F. had inquired why he
had not come and remarked that she saw nothing of him nowadays,
did not render him more inclined for conversation.&nbsp; After
supper, too, instead of smoking quietly, he sat fidgeting in his
chair for a few minutes, and then, rising hastily, fell to pacing
about the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem mortal onaisy this evening,&rsquo; remarked
the farmer, after these perambulations had continued some
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit down, and light up like a decent
Christian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pushed forward a chair invitingly with his foot, and
Richard took it and drew his pipe from his pocket.</p>
<p>Ugh!&nbsp; How hot and stuffy it was in this kitchen, where,
in spite of the warm weather, a fire was blazing!&nbsp; The
windows had not been opened all day, he felt sure; the odour of
their recent repast still lingered in the air, mingled with the
fumes of the particularly rank pipe which his uncle was then
enjoying.&nbsp; He thought of the cool twilight without, of the
downs with the fresh breeze blowing across them, of the path
beside the hedge <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>that led to Littlecomb, of the garden there&mdash;the
garden where the thrush was singing, and where the roses and
syringa were in full bloom.&nbsp; Ah, he could picture to himself
the syringa with its white blossoms shining like pale lamps amid
the dusky boughs.&nbsp; The garden still, and sweet, and
dewy&mdash;where she was wandering at this hour!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Light up, man,&rsquo; said Isaac, pointing to
Richard&rsquo;s pipe.</p>
<p>His nephew obeyed, but held it absently between his
fingers.</p>
<p>Isaac poked the blazing logs with his foot and bent forward,
extending his hands to the glow; his big red face looked
unnaturally large through the surrounding haze of smoke.&nbsp;
Richard half rose from his chair, and then sank back again.&nbsp;
Outside, came the tantalising thought again, outside&mdash;a few
paces away, were the downs and the lonely path through the
fields, and then the garden.</p>
<p>The farmer was slowly nodding in the comfortable
radiance.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s unused pipe had gone out.&nbsp;
<i>The garden</i>!&nbsp; <i>The garden</i>!</p>
<p>Suddenly he rose from his chair, strode across the room, flung
open the door, and was gone before his uncle had time to do more
than turn his head.</p>

away!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shelley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> outside, Richard flew along as
though pursued by a thousand demons; here were the downs, with
their delicious tart air&mdash;but he raced across them without
pausing to inhale it; now to swing over the hedge and to cover
the ground that still lay between him and the garden.&nbsp; The
garden and her!&nbsp; His heart was thumping loudly against his
ribs; a sound as of a rushing sea was in his ears.&nbsp; On, on!
there were the lights twinkling from under the dark
eaves&mdash;there was the gate set in the high wall.&nbsp; How it
shook beneath his violent hand as he flung it open!&nbsp; He
stood still at last, hardly breathing in his suspense.&nbsp; Was
she there?&nbsp; All was still save for the rustling of the
boughs and the faint warbling of the birds&mdash;more than one
was celebrating evensong to-night.&nbsp; <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>What if she
should not be there!&nbsp; He walked on, slowly and unsteadily
now, and presently there was a movement amid the greenery close
at hand.&nbsp; Out of a little arbour set amid the shrubs a
figure came gliding forth to meet him.&nbsp; She paused two paces
away from him and her hands fell by her sides.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is you?&rsquo; she said, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They stood facing each other in unbroken silence for a full
minute, and then she asked, still in that breathless whisper:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I could not keep away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned and began slowly to pace down the path between the
roses.&nbsp; Waves of perfume were wafted to their nostrils from
the syringa blossom.&nbsp; Yes, yonder stood the bush just as he
had pictured to himself.&nbsp; The remembrance suddenly flashed
across Richard as he walked beside her that these shrubs were
sometimes called &lsquo;Mock Orange Trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Mock
Orange Trees</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mock Orange Blossom</i>!&mdash;he must
not pursue that thought further.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I kept away for four days,&rsquo; he said
suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tried to keep away to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a long pause she faltered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was wondering why you did not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>He
made no answer, and they walked in silence till the end of the
path was reached, and then she said, still falteringly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to have come
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I ought not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They turned and began to retrace their steps, but when about
mid-way up the garden she came to a standstill and looked him
full in the face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go now,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go!&nbsp; You
must not stay here any longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even in the dim light he could see that she was pale and that
her figure wavered; but he gazed at her as though without
realising the sense of her words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you not leave me,&rsquo; she entreated,
&lsquo;when I ask you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood looking at her stupidly for a moment or two longer;
then the meaning of her request seemed to reach his
understanding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will go,&rsquo; he said hoarsely, &lsquo;if you will
give me those flowers in your hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How foolish you are!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, yes, take them, and for Heaven&rsquo;s sake
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thrust them towards him, and he took them from her
hand&mdash;a cluster of roses, moist and sweet.&nbsp; Instead of
fulfilling his promise, however, he made a step closer to
her.</p>
<p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&lsquo;Will you put them in my coat?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; His eyes in his haggard face seemed to burn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Rosalie, drawing back.</p>
<p>The movement and the icy tone that accompanied it recalled him
to himself.&nbsp; He, too, drew back, hesitated, and then,
throwing the flowers on the ground with a passionate gesture,
departed.&nbsp; Back again through the gate, across the yard,
under the lea of the hedge, over the downs.</p>
<p>Here was home; there was the warm light of the fire by which
his uncle sat.&nbsp; Now the door was open, and he stood once
more in his presence; now, he, Richard, would be forced to look
him in the face.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood with the door-handle in his hand, and
then, as the old man turned to smile inquiringly upon him, he
suddenly wheeled and fled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he cried, as he mounted the
stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac stared at the closed door for some moments as though
expecting it to open again, then, slowly turning back to the
fire, listened.</p>
<p>In the room overhead hasty steps were walking up and down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He be gone to fetch summat, very like,&rsquo; <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>remarked
the farmer as he restored his pipe to his mouth.&nbsp; But after
smoking and listening a little longer, and marking that the
pacing to and fro continued without intermission, he jerked his
thumb upwards, nodded, and said, &lsquo;He bain&rsquo;t
a-comin&rsquo; back.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, after pausing a moment to
ruminate over this circumstance, he made up his mind to the
inevitable, tapped his pipe upon the hob, extinguished the lamp,
and went upstairs to bed.</p>
<p>And long after he was sunk in dreamless slumbers those hasty
footsteps might have been heard in the adjoining room, pacing up
and down, up and down, like the restless tread of a caged
beast.</p>
<p>Richard was not the only one who spent an unquiet night.&nbsp;
Rosalie, too, could find no rest for her aching heart.&nbsp;
After some hours of feverish tossing she rose, dressed in the dim
grey light that was just stealing over the world, and seated
herself by the open window.&nbsp; She could meditate here without
risk of being disturbed, for the sun would not rise for an hour
and more; and even the earliest of her men would not appear until
some time after dawn.</p>
<p>With her chin resting on her hand, she <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>hearkened
vaguely to the succession of sounds which betokened the awakening
of Nature.&nbsp; The cock had crowed long before she had left her
uneasy pillow; the young sparrows had been chirping while she had
clothed her weary frame; but now the cuckoo&rsquo;s note was
sounding faintly from a neighbouring copse, and the starlings
were chattering in their nests on the ivied wall.&nbsp; The grey
veil was being gradually withdrawn from the face of the earth,
but even yet familiar objects were only half revealed, and the
most well-known had a strange and unreal look.</p>
<p>The first sunbeam had not yet struck across the sky when
Rosalie, whose eyes had been absently fixed upon the irregular
line of hedge which marked the approach to the barton, saw a dark
object moving slowly along it, and presently into the open space
before her gate there stepped the figure of a man.&nbsp; She knew
what man it was even before he had vaulted the locked gate and
taken up his stand beneath her window.&nbsp; She would have given
worlds to close this window and hasten out of sight, but a spell
seemed to be laid upon her, and she could neither move nor speak,
only gaze downward with dilated frightened eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are there?&rsquo; said Richard, looking up <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>with a face
as drawn and white as her own.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank God!&nbsp; I
wanted to see you before I go.&nbsp; I wanted to say
Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The power of speech returned to her, and she leaned forth
impulsively with a faint cry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Going!&nbsp; You are
going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am going.&nbsp; Is it not the only thing I can
do?&nbsp; Do you think I can bear to sit at his table and take
his pay, and know that I am a traitor to him in my
heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie did not speak; but Richard, gazing upwards, saw the
clasp of her hands tighten, as they rested on the sill, till the
nails and knuckles showed white.</p>
<p>He went on passionately: &lsquo;Every word he says to me stabs
me.&nbsp; Every time I look at his honest, unsuspicious face I
feel&mdash;surely you must know what I feel!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
quite a brute yet!&nbsp; And later, when you are his
wife&mdash;do you think it would be possible for me to go on
living within a stone&rsquo;s throw&mdash;to see you every
day&mdash;to keep up the farce of friendship?&nbsp; What do you
think I am made of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face was set like marble; only the eyes moved.&nbsp; After
a long pause she whispered: &lsquo;Will you&mdash;ever come
back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who knows?&rsquo; he answered with a harsh <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some time perhaps&mdash;when I am
quite old&mdash;when I can no longer feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hand before her eyes, and then let it drop.&nbsp;
Richard saw the irrepressible anguish in them, and his face
changed.&nbsp; He threw up his arms suddenly with a kind of a
sob:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not go&mdash;if you tell me to stay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a moment longer the agonised eyes looked down into his,
and he thought he saw her waver; but it was only for a
moment.&nbsp; Her lips moved, at first without emitting any
sound, but presently mastering herself, she said firmly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I tell you to go&mdash;it is right for you to
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; said Richard hoarsely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; faltered Rosalie; and then there came
a great sob: &lsquo;God bless you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned as if to leave her, but wheeling round, looked
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to have nothing?&nbsp; Am I to be sent away
without so much as a clasp of the hand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had vanished from the window, and for a moment he stood
holding his breath; would she come down to him&mdash;would she
meet him at the door?</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>But
within all was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will not come,&rsquo; he said to himself; and once
more went on his way, staggering blindly forward, with his head
sunk upon his breast.</p>
<p>Had he looked back again he might have seen her creep to the
window and kneel by it, straining her eyes through streaming
tears.</p>
<p>Poor Rosalie!&nbsp; Poor Beauty!&nbsp; Did she wake at last
only to look upon the vanishing form of her Prince?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Later in the day Isaac Sharpe came to Littlecomb in great
perturbation of mind.&nbsp; He found Rosalie lying on the couch
in the parlour, the blind being drawn down&mdash;she had a
headache, she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive!&rsquo; said Isaac, sitting down, a
hand on either knee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything d&rsquo; seem to be
goin&rsquo; wrong this day!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my nevvy gone off
wi&rsquo; himself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone?&rsquo; echoed Rosalie, faintly, turning her face
to the wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, took himself off this morning wi&rsquo;out
a word to anyone, and left this here bit of a note for to
explain.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t much of a hand at letter
readin&rsquo;, but Bithey did read it for me, and he does
n&rsquo;t seem to give no excuse at <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>all, except that he were
feelin&rsquo; restless.&nbsp; He says he al&rsquo;ays told me he
were a rover, and could n&rsquo;t settle down, and now the
travellin&rsquo; fit have come on him and he felt he must be
off.&nbsp; And he thanks me very handsome, and he tells me he
don&rsquo;t know where he be a-goin&rsquo; to yet, but when he
does he&rsquo;ll write and let me know where to send his
luggage.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; repeated Rosalie, looking at the
kind, troubled old face with a bewildered stare.&nbsp; That was
all, of course; and she had known it before.&nbsp; She had with
her own eyes watched Richard&rsquo;s departing figure until it
had disappeared from sight.&nbsp; She had known quite well that
he would never return; she had even told him to go, agreed with
him that it was the right and honourable thing to do&mdash;the
only thing to do.&nbsp; Ever since the morning she had been
telling herself so over and over again; yet none the less the
farmer&rsquo;s words fell like a knell upon her heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do look bad, to be sure&mdash;I am sorry your head
be so bad.&nbsp; Lard!&nbsp; Lard, what a world this be!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m that upset I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m on my
head or my heels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The quaver in his voice smote Rosalie.&nbsp; She must make an
effort to overcome her <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>selfish grief; above all, to conquer
that mad spirit of rebellion which every now and then rose
rampant within her.&nbsp; This good man had need of her sympathy;
should she not give it all the more willingly that there was so
large an element of remorse mingled with her misery?&nbsp; She
sat up and looked affectionately towards him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very, very sorry for you,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T was so sudden, ye see,&rsquo; pursued Isaac
dolefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;He never so much as said a word to
I&mdash;never so much as hinted as he war n&rsquo;t
satisfied.&nbsp; I mid ha&rsquo; seen that the restless fit were
a-comin&rsquo; on if I had n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been sich a
sammy.&nbsp; Restless!&nbsp; He were that restless last night, he
were more like a dog at a fair as had lost his master nor a
reasonable human being!&nbsp; It was up and down, and in and out
the whole blessed evening.&nbsp; Ah, I be terrible upset; I be
oncommon fond o&rsquo; Richard, d&rsquo; ye see.&nbsp; Always was
from the time he were a little &rsquo;un.&nbsp; I was oncommon
fond o&rsquo; his mother afore him; she were the only woman I
ever could put up wi&rsquo;&mdash;present company
excepted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Isaac ducked his head towards her with a melancholy attempt
at jocularity, Rosalie&rsquo;s heart sank lower still; she turned
away hastily that he might not see her face.&nbsp; At an <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>earlier
period she might have been gratified by the knowledge that she
was one of the few women in the world whom Isaac Sharpe could
&lsquo;put up with&rsquo;&mdash;phrases of the kind were his
nearest approach to ardour, and indicated, as she knew, a
considerable amount of solid attachment; but the passionate tones
of Richard&rsquo;s voice had rung too recently in her
ear&mdash;the look in his eyes was too fresh in her memory.&nbsp;
Ah, what had she not seen in those eyes!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; went on her unconscious future
husband, &lsquo;&rsquo;ees, I&rsquo;ll be like to miss &rsquo;en;
him and me was the best of friends&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not
all.&nbsp; His leaving me like this be terrible ill-convenient
just now&mdash;&rsquo;t is the busy time of year, d&rsquo;ye
see&mdash;haymaking time&mdash;every pair o&rsquo; hands is
wanted.&nbsp; Richard did very near the work o&rsquo; two men;
and he must go trapesing off wi&rsquo; hisself, giving me no time
at all to find somebody to take his place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a distinct sense of injury in his tone now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure he never thought of that,&rsquo; cried
Rosalie, quickly and resentfully.&nbsp; How could Isaac find it
in his heart to think of such things in the face of the
overwhelming fact that Richard was gone!</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&lsquo;Ah, sure he did n&rsquo;t,&rsquo; agreed
Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;T is a very bad job!&nbsp; A very bad
job indeed; but I suppose there bain&rsquo;t nothing to be
done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie agreed with a sigh.&nbsp; It was too true; there was
nothing to be done.</p>

Ce qu&rsquo;est au feu le vent;<br />
Il &eacute;teint le petit,<br />
Mais it allume le grand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> days passed, and Richard
made no sign.&nbsp; Rosalie went about looking like the ghost of
herself.&nbsp; It was known that she was suffering from a very
severe attack of neuralgia, which, oddly enough, had first seized
her on the very day of Richard Marshall&rsquo;s sudden
departure.</p>
<p>Some guileless people believed in the neuralgia&mdash;poor
Mrs. Fiander did look so very bad, and a body could n&rsquo;t
make believe to be so pale.&nbsp; Others, among whom was Mrs.
Belbin, folded their arms and assumed a knowing air.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T was likely enough, averred this matron, for folks to
look pale as had reason to.&nbsp; Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;s conscience
was very likely a-troublin&rsquo; o&rsquo; she.&nbsp; She was a
terrible one for carryin&rsquo; on wi&rsquo; young
men&mdash;a-leadin&rsquo; of them on, and then a-sendin&rsquo;
them <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>off
wi&rsquo;out no reason.&nbsp; Her Sam could say somethin&rsquo;
if he &rsquo;d a mind&mdash;her Sam did know more than he did
like to talk about.&nbsp; Others, again, were of opinion that
Mrs. Fiander was just wasting away for love of Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s
nephew, and that that young man had gone of his own accord, and
had not been dismissed by the widow.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was n&rsquo;t
very likely, said these sages, that Richard Marshall, who had his
own way to make in the world, and who was known to have great
expectations from his uncle, would wish to have any
unpleasantness with him.&nbsp; In response to the suggestion that
the young man would n&rsquo;t be a-doin&rsquo; so very bad for
hisself if he and Widow Fiander made a match of it, they returned
conclusively that it was quite unpossible for him and Widow
Fiander to make a match of it, since her banns were to be given
out almost immediately with Farmer Sharpe.&nbsp; Somebody had up
and axed Mrs. Fiander when the wedding was to be, and she had
answered that the day was not yet fixed, but that the wedding was
to take place as agreed at the end of July.</p>
<p>Isaac heard none of these rumours, but he too wandered about
with an unusually lengthy and gloomy face.</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>One
day, however, Rosalie, looking out from the darkened room where
she was sitting, saw him hastening towards her house with every
appearance of excitement, waving a piece of paper in his
hand.</p>
<p>In a moment she stood on the threshold.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
heard from Richard?&rsquo; she cried eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have had a letter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, my dear, I have n&rsquo;t had no letter,&rsquo;
panted Isaac, as soon as he was near enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
&rsquo;ve had a graft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have had what?&rsquo; inquired Rosalie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had a graft, my dear, a tele-graft&mdash;in one
of them nasty-lookin&rsquo; yeller wrappers as al&rsquo;ays seems
to bring bad news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it has n&rsquo;t brought bad news this
time,&rsquo; said she tremulously, as they went into the house
together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I hope not,&rsquo; said the farmer
doubtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It does n&rsquo;t say much, d&rsquo; ye
see&mdash;not much one way or t&rsquo; other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Smoothing out the paper, he handed it to her upside down.</p>
<p>Rosalie reversed it, and read the brief message:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send luggage as soon as possible Lime Street Station,
Liverpool, to be called for.&mdash;Richard.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>&lsquo;Liverpool!&nbsp; Then he must intend to go to
America again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac flushed, and his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mrs. F., I do call that a-jumpin&rsquo; to
conclusions,&rsquo; he said presently, quite testily for
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have n&rsquo;t no earthly reason for
sayin&rsquo; sich a thing.&nbsp; Is it likely my nevvy &rsquo;ud
go off to &rsquo;Merica again when he&rsquo;s only just a-comed
back?&nbsp; Did n&rsquo;t he say he was a-longin&rsquo; and
a-longin&rsquo; to be back to the old country&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; interrupted Rosalie quickly; &lsquo;but
for all that I&rsquo;m sure he means to return to America
now.&nbsp; He told me he landed at Liverpool, and, depend upon
it, he intends to start from there again.&nbsp; Yes, yes,
I&rsquo;m quite sure of it.&nbsp; He did not rest, you see, until
he had put the length of the country between us, and now he means
to go further still&mdash;perhaps when he is at the other side of
the world he will be contented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with irrepressible bitterness, but Isaac did not
notice it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s your opinion, Mrs. F.,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;we &rsquo;d best lose no time in carryin&rsquo; out my
little plan.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ve got a plan, d&rsquo; ye
see,&rsquo; he added, with modest triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, it
comed to me all of a sudden.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll write to him, Mrs.
F.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>&lsquo;But what would be the use of writing?&rsquo;
said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;We cannot force him to come back
against his will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, we can&rsquo;t force him, but I think &rsquo;t is
only some notion the chap&rsquo;s got in his head.&nbsp; He
seemed quite settled till last week, and maybe the rovin&rsquo;
fit will ha&rsquo; wore off a bit by now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone
all the way to Liverpool, d&rsquo; ye see&mdash;that ought to
ha&rsquo; let off a bit o&rsquo; steam.&nbsp; Maybe, if we wrote
him a letter and just axed him straight out, he might change his
mind.&nbsp; We can send a letter with his luggage&mdash;&rsquo;t
won&rsquo;t be too late so long as he has n&rsquo;t left the
country; and he can&rsquo;t leave the country wi&rsquo;out his
luggage, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp; We can but try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course&mdash;you can try,&rsquo; said Rosalie,
pressing her hand to her head with a bewildered air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, I were thinkin&rsquo;, Mrs. F., if ye &rsquo;d jist
set down and drop a line to &rsquo;en for me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
to say, if your head bain&rsquo;t a-troublin&rsquo; you too
much&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was looking at her pleadingly, misunderstanding the
expression of her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind about my head.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only
wondering&mdash;I&rsquo;m only thinking.&nbsp; Must the letter go
to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well ye see, Richard did ax most perticlar <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>for his
traps to be sent off at once,&rsquo; replied the farmer, his eyes
round with anxiety; &lsquo;and if we don&rsquo;t send the letter
at the same time we mid miss him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bithey used always to write to him for you,
didn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; said Rosalie, catching at the last
straw.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps it would have more effect if she
wrote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now, my dear, if ye &rsquo;d be so obligin&rsquo;,
I &rsquo;d take it very kind o&rsquo; you to do it.&nbsp; It
d&rsquo; take Bithey very near three days to write a
letter&mdash;I &rsquo;d be very much obliged to &rsquo;ee, my
dear,&rsquo; he repeated persuasively.</p>
<p>Thus adjured she had no resource but to comply, and with a
beating heart and throbbing brain she set about her
preparations.&nbsp; Going to the window, she drew up the blind a
little way, and then, collecting pen, ink, and paper, sat down
opposite Isaac at the table.&nbsp; When she had thus inaugurated
proceedings Isaac might have been observed to gather himself up,
concentrating, as it were, all his forces in preparation to the
effort of composition.</p>
<p>Having dipped her pen in the ink, Rosalie looked inquiringly
at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you wish me to begin?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bithey do al&rsquo;ays start off wi&rsquo; &ldquo;My
dear Nevvy,&rdquo;&rsquo; responded Isaac in a husky tone, as <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>though he
were speaking from beneath a blanket, which evidently resulted
from the mighty constraint he was putting upon himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>My dear Nephew</i>,&rsquo; wrote Rosalie, and then
she raised her eyes again.</p>
<p>The farmer cleared his throat, drew a long breath, and
continued slowly, and with apparently immense difficulty:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Your uncle Isaac do say</i>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say,&rsquo; repeated Rosalie, when she had written the
last word.</p>
<p>Isaac, crimson in the face, was absorbed in the mental
struggle, but presently perceived with a start that her pen had
stopped moving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have &rsquo;ee got <i>Say</i>?&nbsp; Well, <i>Your
uncle Isaac do say</i>&mdash;<i>as I hope you&rsquo;ll change
your mind</i>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had n&rsquo;t I better put <i>he</i> hopes?&rsquo; said
the secretary.</p>
<p>The farmer came out of his brown study, and looked up at her
inquiringly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why you, of course.&nbsp; If I say, &ldquo;Your uncle
Isaac,&rdquo; I ought to go on in the same way, &ldquo;He
says.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I say &ldquo;I&rdquo; it will look as if I
were speaking of myself&mdash;as if it were <i>I</i> who wished
he would change his mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>&lsquo;Well, and don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee wish it?&rsquo;
asked Isaac sharply, but reproachfully too.</p>
<p>Rosalie bent her head over the paper, and answered
hurriedly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&nbsp; Oh, of course, of course; but it would not do
for me to tell him so&mdash;it would be too much of a
liberty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, no, my dear.&nbsp; Richard would n&rsquo;t think
it such.&nbsp; But there, I be dathered with so much
talk&mdash;you must n&rsquo;t cut in again, Mrs.
F.&mdash;&rsquo;t is terrible hard work writin&rsquo; letters,
and if ye go for to speak to I in the middle I&rsquo;ll be all
mixed up.&nbsp; Let me tell &rsquo;ee my own way, d&rsquo; ye
see?&mdash;Richard knows my ways, and he&rsquo;ll understand fast
enough.&nbsp; Now, let me see:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Your uncle Isaac
wishes for to say as I hope ye&rsquo;ll change your mind and come
back</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. F. is a-writin&rsquo; this for I</i>,
<i>and she wishes for to say &rsquo;t is Uncle Isaac as wants
&rsquo;ee back</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;ll make it all right,
d&rsquo; ye see?&rsquo; he continued, dropping the high unnatural
tone which seemed essential to dictation, and adopting a
confidential one&mdash;&lsquo;now he can&rsquo;t go for to make
no mistakes.&nbsp; Have &rsquo;ee wrote that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t make me write that, Mr.
Sharpe&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want him to think me
unkind.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Isaac
clicked his tongue in desperation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard ha&rsquo; mercy!&rsquo; he ejaculated, &lsquo;this
here letter &rsquo;ull never get wrote.&nbsp; Now, my dear, jist
put down what I d&rsquo; tell &rsquo;ee&mdash;and don&rsquo;t
flurry me.&nbsp; When I do get flurried I can&rsquo;t for the
life o&rsquo; me think o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Jist be
a-puttin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that down, and I&rsquo;ll go on
thinkin&rsquo;, d&rsquo; ye see.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll come
right&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;ll come right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie reluctantly set down the required sentence, and found
at its conclusion that Isaac had already inflated himself in
preparation for a further effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Mrs. F. d&rsquo; wish &rsquo;ee to come back
too</i>, <i>as is nat&rsquo;ral</i>, <i>but she thinks it more
becomin&rsquo; not to say so</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fixed his eyes sternly upon her as he enunciated this
statement, and in sheer desperation Rosalie set it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now ye have n&rsquo;t nothing to complain of, I
don&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; he remarked triumphantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now we can get on.&nbsp; Well&mdash;what next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>After deep reflection the following words came forth:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;<i>T is most onconvenient for &rsquo;ee to be
a-leavin&rsquo; me at such short notice</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I</i>&mdash;<i>wish</i>&mdash;<i>&rsquo;ee</i>&mdash;<i>most</i>&mdash;<i>pertic&rsquo;lar</i>&mdash;<i>to</i>&mdash;<i>come</i>&mdash;<i>back</i>&mdash;<i>to-week</i>.&nbsp;
<i>We be a goin&rsquo; to cut the church meadow</i>, <i>and
</i><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span><i>every hand be wanted</i>.&nbsp; <i>I do feel a bit
hurt in my feelin&rsquo;s</i>&rsquo;&mdash;Here Isaac paused to
brush his coat sleeve across his eyes, and continued
brokenly&mdash;&lsquo;<i>hurt in my feelin&rsquo;s to think as
you have a-left your old uncle like that</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;T war
n&rsquo;t well done o&rsquo; him,&rsquo; he muttered,
parenthetically, &lsquo;nay, I can&rsquo;t say as it were well
done o&rsquo; Richard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wiped his eyes again, sniffed, drew an immense breath, and
started off afresh:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Like that</i>.&nbsp; <i>I do think ye mid ha&rsquo;
said a word</i>, <i>but I will not find fault no more</i>, <i>but
jist ax ye to come straight back</i>&mdash;<i>an&rsquo; all will
be forgive and forgot</i>.&nbsp; Now I think, Mrs. F., we mid
finish, ye mid jist write my name and I&rsquo;ll put my mark to
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He heaved a deep sigh of relief, wiped his brow, and sat
gazing at her as she appended his signature to the page.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That be my name, be it?&rsquo; he inquired.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It do look very pretty wrote out so nice and small.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees, I can see as this here&rsquo;s my name.&nbsp;
<i>I</i>&mdash;<i>S</i>&mdash;<i>A</i>&mdash;.&nbsp; You put
<i>A</i> twice, Mrs. F.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it should be written twice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the farmer, gazing at the page
doubtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bithey now do only put it once&mdash;it
be a matter o&rsquo; taste, I suppose.&nbsp; Well, now,
I&rsquo;ll put my mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>He
ground his pen slowly into the paper, horizontally and
perpendicularly, and remained gazing at it with a certain modest
pride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, shut &rsquo;en up now, and write his name
outside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie obeyed, and held out the document towards Isaac, but
as he was about to take it she drew it back, a deep flush
overspreading her face.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
however, she again tendered it to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;take it,&rsquo; she said, with a note of
sharpness in her voice which would have struck a more acute
observer than Isaac; but he duly pocketed it without noticing
that anything was amiss.</p>
<p>Left to herself she sat for a moment or two in deep thought,
her chin propped upon her hands; then suddenly rising, rushed out
into the yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sharpe!&rsquo; she called.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Isaac!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the farmer&rsquo;s broad back was already vanishing down
the lane.&nbsp; Evidently her voice failed to reach him as he did
not turn his head.&nbsp; Rosalie stood looking after him, without
making further attempts to attract his attention, and then slowly
returned to the house.&nbsp; Why should she call him back, after
all&mdash;what need was there for her thus to <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>disturb
herself?&nbsp; Could she help writing the letter exactly as he
wished; and how foolish were the qualms of conscience which the
remembrance of certain phrases in it evoked.&nbsp; It was his
letter, not hers: it was he who had insisted on stating that she
wished Richard to return&mdash;she had never authorised him to do
so.&nbsp; If Richard did come back she could not be blamed for
it.&nbsp; If he did come back!</p>
<p>Again supporting her throbbing head with her hands, she tried
to reason with herself, but the turmoil in heart and brain for a
time forbade any consecutive train of ideas.&nbsp; During the
long blank days which had passed since Richard&rsquo;s departure,
and often in the course of the weary, restless nights, this
thought had constantly recurred to her with a never-failing
stab:&mdash;<i>He has gone</i>&mdash;<i>he will never come
back</i>!</p>
<p>And now, if he did come back&mdash;if he came back even for a
little while!&nbsp; If she might just see him again, if it were
only to be once or twice!&nbsp; At the mere suggestion she was
conscious of a lifting of the load which had been crushing
her.&nbsp; If he were made to know, through no fault of hers but
rather against her will, that she did wish him <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>to
return&mdash;she who had let him go forth without a word to stay
him&mdash;if he even guessed that she longed to see him&mdash;oh,
it would be sweet to think he knew, that he would henceforth
judge her less harshly, that he would realise how hard had been
her struggle!</p>
<p>She raised her head, her lips parted in a smile, her eyes
dreamily gazing at the strip of sunlit green outside her
window.&nbsp; There he had stood; thence he had turned away so
mournfully, and now he was to come back.&nbsp; <i>To come
back</i>!&nbsp; Would he not read between the lines of the oddly
composed missive&mdash;would not the very words have for him a
deeper meaning than their guileless originator guessed
at&mdash;would he not come flying to her side?&nbsp; In a few
days&mdash;in little more than a few hours, perhaps, he would be
with her; and then!</p>
<p>She gave a sudden gasp, and flung herself forward across the
table.&nbsp; And then!&nbsp; In a moment the web of
self-deception with which she had been endeavouring to cloak the
situation was torn to shreds, and she saw the truth.&nbsp; A
crisis was impending: it was folly to pretend that it would take
her unawares, it was worse than folly to endeavour to shift the
<a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>responsibility to poor unsuspicious Isaac.&nbsp; If
Richard returned the struggle would have to be gone through
again: it would be even harder than before, for she would have
lured him back after he had broken from her.&nbsp; If thus sorely
tempted and wrongfully encouraged he were to speak those words
which she had seen so often trembling on his lips, what answer
could she make?&nbsp; Could she look him in the face and affect
unconsciousness, or&mdash;what did she mean to do?&nbsp; Did she
mean to keep her plighted troth as an honest woman should, or did
she mean to cast aside, for good and all, truth, and honour, and
self-respect, and jilt the man who had been her faithful
friend?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to do right,&rsquo; said Rosalie, with another
gasping sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never told a lie in my life; I
won&rsquo;t tell one now; I won&rsquo;t act one either.&nbsp; If
he comes back it will only be on false pretences; he must
n&rsquo;t be allowed to come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She lay still for a moment, her arms extended, a kind of
tremor passing every now and then over her frame.&nbsp; Presently
she said again, half aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be deceitful; I won&rsquo;t break my
word; but oh, how hard it is to do right!&nbsp; God help
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>She
straightened herself all at once, and pushed back the hair from
her forehead; then, drawing the blotter towards her, wrote a
hasty line on a sheet of paper&mdash;&lsquo;Do not come back, I
implore you.&nbsp; R. F.&rsquo;&mdash;thrust it into an envelope,
and directed it to Richard.&nbsp; With little convulsive sobs at
intervals she went upstairs, bathed her swollen eyes, and put on
her hat.</p>
<p>There was no one about the Down Farm when she approached it,
but, on entering, she almost fell over a strapped portmanteau
that had been placed just inside the doorway.&nbsp; As she
recovered herself Bithey appeared at the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you was the carrier,&rsquo; she
remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Master did say as he &rsquo;d sent for him
to fetch that there box o&rsquo; Richard Marshall&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&rsquo;T is to go to Liverpool to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Sharpe in?&rsquo; asked Rosalie
falteringly.&nbsp; Somehow the sight of that portmanteau made her
turn suddenly faint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, he bain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
expectin&rsquo; him back every minute.&nbsp; He be gone some time
now, and he said he &rsquo;d just catch the carrier.&nbsp; I had
a hard job to get all packed and ready, but &rsquo;t is done
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was all packed, the straps fastened, the <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>lock made
secure.&nbsp; Rosalie was too late after all; the important
postscript which was to supplement the letter could not, as she
intended, be slipped among Richard&rsquo;s effects.&nbsp; Her
heart gave a sudden throb that was not altogether of pain.&nbsp;
She had honestly tried, but fate willed otherwise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll wait,&rsquo; she
stammered, scarcely knowing what she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall
see Mr. Sharpe to-morrow, and I should only be in your way.&nbsp;
I dare say you are busy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, not that busy now, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
just a-makin&rsquo; a parcel of a big thick coat o&rsquo;
Richard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &rsquo;T would n&rsquo;t go in the box
nohow, and I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to pack it in paper, but
&rsquo;t is that heavy it do slip out at one side so soon as I
get t&rsquo; other wrapped up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me help you,&rsquo; said Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Four
hands are better than two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had never seen Richard wear this coat, yet the mere sight
of it&mdash;the mere consciousness that it was his caused a
recurrence of that strange wave of faintness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We want a little bit more string, Bithey,&rsquo; she
said with the quaver in her voice which had been noticeable
before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s a little bit on the dresser
shelf,&rsquo; returned the old woman; and, dropping <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>her end of
the parcel, she went across the kitchen.</p>
<p>This was Rosalie&rsquo;s chance.&nbsp; She was white to the
very lips, but she did not flinch.&nbsp; With cold, trembling
fingers, she hid away the note in the breast-pocket of the coat;
he would be sure to find it there.</p>
<p>Bithey discovered nothing, and presently, the packet being
secured, Rosalie betook herself homewards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I &rsquo;ve done it!&rsquo; she said, pausing when she
reached the solitude of the downs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank God!&nbsp;
I &rsquo;ve done it!&nbsp; It will be all right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not surprising that in the midst of her
self-congratulations on having so successfully barred herself out
of Eden she should once more melt into tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cutting and making of
Rosalie&rsquo;s hay had been proceeding briskly in the Church
Meadow; the last swathes had fallen, and every available pair of
hands had been called upon to assist in the work, for experienced
weather-prophets had foretold gloomily that the actual
&lsquo;fine spell&rsquo; could not be expected to last.</p>
<p>Towards evening on the second day Farmer Sharpe stood alone in
the centre of the field; mopped, for the hundredth time, his
perspiring brow, and cast a contemplative look round.</p>
<p>&rsquo;T was past seven o&rsquo;clock; the men had gone home
some time before, but he had remained to take a final survey of
the scene of their labours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so very like to
rain,&rsquo; remarked Isaac, looking up at the sky, where,
indeed, no trace of a cloud was to be seen.&nbsp; <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>&lsquo;Nay,
I don&rsquo;t hold wi&rsquo; Job&mdash;&rsquo;t will keep up for
a bit yet.&nbsp; Mrs. F. &rsquo;ull ha&rsquo; gone home by now, I
should think&mdash;she&rsquo;d begin to find it a bit damp in the
dell.&nbsp; The dew be falling very fast.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
go home to my supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He passed through the gate at the further end of the field,
and had traversed more than half the distance which separated him
from his home when the sound of heavy but rapid steps behind him
made him halt and turn round.</p>
<p>Job Hunt, who had evidently been hastening in pursuit of him,
paused too, his great red face wearing an appearance of unusual
excitement, and his sly blue eyes positively goggling in his
head.&nbsp; Owing to the unusual press of work, and the need for
accomplishing it in a given time, Isaac had persuaded Rosalie to
consent to his engaging this unwelcome addition to her forces,
and she had agreed with a meekness that sufficiently indicated
her spiritless condition.&nbsp; Job it was who had been most
energetic in foretelling a coming storm, partly in order to
render his services the more valuable, and partly because of a
natural pleasure in predicting disaster to Mrs. Fiander&rsquo;s
crops.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Isaac, gazing at him in
astonishment.</p>
<p><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>&lsquo;Have &rsquo;ee seen what be goin&rsquo; on
yonder, sir?&rsquo; was Job&rsquo;s counter-query.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What be a-goin&rsquo; on where?&rsquo; inquired the
farmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, there,&rsquo; returned Hunt, with a significant
jerk of the thumb in the direction of the Church Meadow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There bain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; at all a-goin&rsquo;
on there,&rsquo; returned his employer sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I be
just come from there&mdash;the field&rsquo;s empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Mr. Sharpe,&rsquo; returned Job, half closing one
eye, and assuming a very knowing look.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, it
bain&rsquo;t empty.&nbsp; Jist you step back and see.&nbsp; If
you was to step up to the dell very cautious&mdash;I&rsquo;d
advise &rsquo;ee to go very cautious, sir&mdash;you &rsquo;d
maybe see summat as &rsquo;ud surprise &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Jist you
come along wi&rsquo; I, Mr. Sharpe&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show
&rsquo;ee where to look, and I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low ye&rsquo;ll be
astonished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac surveyed him for half a minute or so without speaking,
and then slowly jerked his thumb forwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cut away,&rsquo; he said briefly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, I don&rsquo;t mind if I do come, but I
don&rsquo;t expect to see nothin&rsquo; surprisin&rsquo; at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Job grinned derisively for all rejoinder, and led the way as
requested; walking with exaggerated caution, and turning his
malevolent <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>red-bearded face over his shoulder every now and then
to make sure that Isaac was following.&nbsp; The latter shambled
along at his usual pace and with a perfectly imperturbable
face.</p>
<p>As they drew near the dell, a small cup-shaped pit surrounded
by bushes at the upper end of the field, the sound of voices was
distinctly audible&mdash;two voices, a man&rsquo;s and a
woman&rsquo;s&mdash;speaking, however, so low that even when
Isaac and his companion were close to the brink they could
distinguish no words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jist step for&rsquo;ard, Mr. Sharpe, sir,&rsquo;
whispered Job excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jist look down through the
bushes; I&rsquo;ll bide here till ye come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sharpe paused for a moment or two, staring at him with evident
displeasure, and then went forward.&nbsp; Presently his tall form
towered above the bushes, and he looked down into the pit
beneath.</p>
<p>After a long and steady gaze he returned to Job, took him by
the shoulder, and propelled him to a safe distance from the
tantalising spot.&nbsp; Job, when finally released, examined him
with great curiosity; but the farmer&rsquo;s face, though a
little redder than usual, in consequence probably of his recent
exertions, was stolid as ever.</p>
<p><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he said in answer to the
man&rsquo;s inquiring gaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, did &rsquo;ee see who was there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I did.&nbsp; Mrs. Fiander was there, where I
left her, and my nevvy was there.&nbsp; He &rsquo;ve comed home,
I see, as I axed him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Job, much disappointed, &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you were expectin&rsquo; of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did n&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, Job?&nbsp; I &rsquo;ve been
expectin&rsquo; of &rsquo;en all this week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad
he&rsquo;s come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems a bit queer as he should be in Mrs.
Fiander&rsquo;s hayfield, instead o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; straight
to your place,&rsquo; urged Job almost plaintively.&nbsp; It was
a little disappointing to find that his great discovery had been
anticipated.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I did see &rsquo;en
b<i>i</i>-c<i>y</i>cling along the road I made sure he must be
going straight to you, and then when I did see his
b<i>i-</i>c<i>y</i>cle leanin&rsquo; agen&rsquo; the hedge, I
jist thought I &rsquo;d see where he &rsquo;d got to&mdash;and
there he were in the dell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very nat&rsquo;ral place for &rsquo;en to
be,&rsquo; returned Isaac in his most matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I did tell &rsquo;en most pertic-lar we was cuttin&rsquo;
the Church Meadow, and when he saw Mrs. Fiander in the dell
&rsquo;t was most nat&rsquo;ral he should go and speak to
her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; queer, Job
Hunt.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>&lsquo;He was a-holdin&rsquo; o&rsquo; both her hands
when I see &rsquo;en,&rsquo; muttered Job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; commented Isaac.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
he&rsquo;ll be a-holdin&rsquo; both mine soon.&nbsp; I be main
glad he be come back.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; home to
my supper, and I think you &rsquo;d do well to go back to yours,
Job.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll expect you early in the field to-morrow; so
the sooner ye get back to look arter your own business the
better.&nbsp; I would n&rsquo;t advise &rsquo;ee to go
interfering wi&rsquo; my nevvy.&nbsp; He bain&rsquo;t so very
fond o&rsquo; folks axin&rsquo; questions or pryin&rsquo;
about.&nbsp; Ah, I &rsquo;ve known &rsquo;en take his fists to a
man once as he thought too curious.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is the way
wi&rsquo; young chaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, fixed his eyes impressively on Hunt, as though to
make sure that the meaning of his words had penetrated to that
somewhat dull-witted gentleman&rsquo;s consciousness, and finally
rolled homewards, to all appearance placid as ever.</p>
<p>He had not proceeded very far before he paused, however, shook
his head, and finally stood stock-still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two hands,&rsquo; said Farmer Sharpe
reflectively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two hands!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>It now becomes necessary to ascertain what passed before Isaac
Sharpe, looking down <a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>through the willow-bushes, descried
Richard Marshall in such close proximity to Mrs. Fiander.</p>
<p>Nothing certainly was farther from Rosalie&rsquo;s thoughts
when she had taken refuge in that sheltered spot from the glare
of the afternoon sun than the expectation of the advent of this
companion.&nbsp; She had, in fact, quite decided that he was by
this time out of the country, and had, indeed, made up her mind
to erase his image definitely from her memory.&nbsp;
Henceforward, as she frequently told herself, she must think only
of Isaac&mdash;Isaac, who had always been her friend, who was so
soon to be her husband.&nbsp; Her husband!&mdash;she must face
the thought though she unconsciously shrank from it.&nbsp; Oh,
would&mdash;would that this sweet cup of forbidden love had never
been held to her lips!&nbsp; She had dashed it from her, but the
taste of it remained and had taken all the savour out of her
life.&nbsp; It had been to her a poisonous cup, containing as it
did wine from the fruit of the tree of knowledge.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>You know very little of life</i>,&rsquo; Richard had
said to her once.&nbsp; Alas, alas! she knew now more than
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Elias&mdash;poor Elias,&rsquo; she groaned to
herself sometimes, &lsquo;why did you die?&nbsp; If you <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>had lived I
should have known nothing&mdash;I should have guessed at
nothing.&nbsp; I might have gone down to my grave without knowing
that there was any other love besides that which I gave
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As an antidote to the rebellious longing of which she was too
often conscious, Rosalie had recourse to the panacea she had
hitherto found unfailing in times of affliction: hard work.&nbsp;
Since the writing of that letter to Richard, and the subsequent
battle with herself, she had resumed her old energetic
habits.&nbsp; Once more she rose with the dawn, once more she
passed hours in toil no less arduous than that allotted to her
servants.&nbsp; She avoided solitude as much as possible, and
strove by every means in her power to tire herself out.</p>
<p>So tired was she, indeed, on this particular afternoon, that,
having sought the friendly shade of the grassy nook already
referred to, she acknowledged herself to be incapable of further
effort.&nbsp; Even when the great heat had somewhat abated, and
the retreating voices and heavy tread of her labourers as they
trooped homewards warned her that it was growing late, she sat
on, her hands clasping her knees, her eyes gazing vacantly on the
ground, too weary even to think.</p>
<p><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>A
footstep sounded in the neighbourhood of her retreat, but she did
not raise her eyes: it was some straggler, probably, hastening to
rejoin the others.&nbsp; She could hear the bushes rustling, as
though brushed by a passing form, and kept very still; she wanted
nobody to speak to her, nobody even to look at her.&nbsp; But now
the step faltered, halted&mdash;there was a pause; and then rapid
feet began to descend towards where she sat.&nbsp; She raised her
eyes, first in surprise and a little irritation, then in
incredulous wonder, then&mdash;oh, what was it that Richard saw
in them?</p>
<p>In a moment he was bending over her and both her hands were
clasped in his.</p>
<p>Was it that particular moment that Job Hunt chose to pursue
his investigations, or did the acknowledged lovers remain thus
longer than they knew?&nbsp; Rosalie could never afterwards tell,
nor could Richard.&nbsp; They felt as if they were in a dream;
time, place, circumstances, were alike forgotten; a vague
undefined bliss&mdash;the intangible bliss of
dreams&mdash;haunted them both, and in the minds of both lurked
the same dread of awakening.</p>
<p>It was Rosalie who was first recalled to life.&nbsp; Her eyes,
which had been fixed on Richard&rsquo;s face, dropped gradually
to his hands; gazed <a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>idly, first at those hands, then at
her own which he was holding; then the idea gradually took shape
in her mind&mdash;those were her hands, Rosalie Fiander&rsquo;s
hands, that were lying in Richard&rsquo;s clasp; and they had no
right to be there!</p>
<p>She snatched them away instantly, and the charm was
broken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have come back!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why
did you come back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;because I received your
letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face was white with anguish; his, on the contrary,
flushed, eager, triumphant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But did you not find the note which I put in your
pocket?&rsquo; she murmured, gazing at him with frightened
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you would be sure to find it.&nbsp;
The other was not&mdash;was not really mine.&nbsp; I had to write
what he wanted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he answered blithely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
could see it plainly enough.&nbsp; It was not that which brought
me home.&nbsp; It was your own precious little note&mdash;the
little line which laid bare your heart to me.&nbsp; I had already
sailed before I found it, but we touched at Queenstown and I
landed there and took the first boat home.&nbsp; I have travelled
night and day since.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>She
was shaking like a reed in the wind.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;I
begged you not to come,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You begged me not to come, sweet, and so I guessed, I
knew&mdash;you betrayed your secret, my dear love, and I felt my
own power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she gasped; &lsquo;you must not speak to
me like this, Richard&mdash;I will not listen.&nbsp; You know
quite well that I cannot listen.&nbsp; I belong to another
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Richard bent nearer still, his face alight with the same
inexplicable triumph&mdash;a triumph that was almost fierce.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You belong to me,&rsquo; he said; and his words were
perhaps the more passionate because spoken so low.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have belonged to me from the first.&nbsp; Even from
the moment when I saw you in the picture I said to
myself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; pleaded Rosalie, in tones as passionate
as his, but infinitely piteous.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not say it,
Richard&mdash;do not&mdash;do not put it into words!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her hand flew out involuntarily as though to stop his mouth:
he caught it and kissed it though it fluttered in his grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I not say it&mdash;why should I not be brave
enough to put into words the thought which has been in both our
minds so <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>often?&nbsp; When I saw your picture I fancied myself
standing beside you, bending over you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, hush, hush!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had withdrawn her hand, and was covering her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said to myself,&rsquo; he persevered, his words
coming brokenly because of his quick breathing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
said to myself, &ldquo;If that woman lives she shall be my
wife&mdash;I will search for her until I find her!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then when I found you&mdash;I thought you were
free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I was not free,&rsquo; she interrupted, dropping
her hands and looking up with eyes fierce and wild like those of
a hunted animal.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not free now, neither are you
free.&nbsp; You are bound to him as much as I am&mdash;your duty
stares you in the face&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too late to talk of duty!&nbsp; I ought never to
have seen you.&nbsp; Do you suppose there is anything which you
can tell me that I have not told myself a hundred times?&nbsp; He
is my uncle&mdash;yes!&nbsp; He has been my benefactor
always&mdash;more than a father to me&mdash;yes, yes!&nbsp; He is
the kindest, the most warm-hearted, the most guileless of
men.&nbsp; It would never enter his honest, innocent mind to
suspect me of trying to supplant him; in acting <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>as I do I
am a traitor, a liar&mdash;vile, ungrateful, dishonourable,
dishonest&mdash;Oh, there are no words strong enough, or black
enough to paint me as I am!&nbsp; I know it and I agree to it;
but I love you, Rosalie, and I will not give you up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some of his words were scarcely audible as they came in gusts
from his quivering lips; the veins on his forehead stood out;
there was no mistaking the bitter contempt with which he
stigmatised his own conduct, but there was even less possibility
of misapprehending his deadly earnestness of purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to have you,&rsquo; he went on; &lsquo;I mean to
let everything go&mdash;except you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so much taken aback at the suddenness of the
onslaught, so confounded at the quickness with which he had
forestalled all she had intended to urge, that she stood before
him for a moment absolutely mute; trembling, moreover, with the
growing consciousness of her own weakness, and at his confident
assumption of mastery over her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he, with his eyes fixed upon her face, read it like
a book.&nbsp; His own suddenly changed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is useless to struggle, love,&rsquo; he said,
speaking very gently and tenderly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>have both
done our best&mdash;we have tried to do right, but Fate has been
too strong for us.&nbsp; We must just make up our minds to let
ourselves go with the tide&mdash;and be happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie was, as has been seen, very impressionable, very
emotional&mdash;in a word, very womanly; but for all that there
was at her heart&rsquo;s core the little kernel of strength which
is to be found in the hearts of most good women&mdash;an
instinctive sense of rectitude, the love of duty for duty&rsquo;s
sake, even when the accomplishment of it involves great
sacrifice.&nbsp; She looked Richard full in the face now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I will not take any
happiness that has to be bought by doing wrong.&nbsp; I made my
own choice and fixed my lot in life before I knew you, and now I
will abide by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The very severity of the struggle gave her courage, and
Richard, all passion-swayed as he was, had in him a certain
element of chivalrousness that responded to the effort she was
making.</p>
<p>He was silent, and Rosalie, quick to perceive her advantage,
went on eagerly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask you to leave me, Richard; I want you to go
now.&nbsp; It is quite true that you <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>have a kind of power over me, and
that if you&rsquo;&mdash;her voice faltered for a moment, but she
steadied it&mdash;&lsquo;if you go on urging me and persuading me
you will very likely make me give in in the end; but I ask you,
<i>because</i> you love me, not to do this.&nbsp; We could not be
really happy if&mdash;if we came together through being
dishonourable and ungrateful.&nbsp; It is better to do right at
all costs.&nbsp; As for me, I mean to keep my word to your
uncle.&nbsp; I will try my best to make him a good wife and to
forget you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you thought,&rsquo; returned he, with a
bitterness which he could not control&mdash;&lsquo;have you
thought at all of what is to become of me?&nbsp; The whole thing
is absurd,&rsquo; he went on with increasing irritation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you think for a moment that my uncle could suffer a
tithe of what I shall suffer?&nbsp; You know very well he is not
capable of it.&nbsp; Besides&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He broke
off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you mean,&rsquo; said Rosalie, colouring
faintly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He would not have thought of marrying me if
I had not first suggested it.&nbsp; But I did suggest it, and he
is very fond of me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fond!&rsquo; echoed the young man scornfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, as fond as it is in his nature to be.&nbsp; <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>He has been
faithful to me, and I will be faithful to him.&nbsp; I will do
nothing that could pain or humiliate him.&nbsp; Some day you too
will feel glad that you have not injured your
benefactor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what do you want me to do?&rsquo; said Richard,
still half sullenly, though she saw by his face that her words
had struck home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to go away now&mdash;go quite away as you
intended&mdash;as fast as you can&mdash;before&mdash;before
anything happens to make us change our minds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the words, in her pleading eyes there was that same piteous
confession of weakness which had before touched Richard, and
which now roused afresh his most generous instincts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do what you wish,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are a good woman, Rosalie; I&mdash;will go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at him quickly, opened her mouth as if to speak,
and then turned away without carrying out her intention.</p>
<p>Thus they parted, without another word or a clasp of the
hands.&nbsp; Richard climbed up the bank and disappeared from
view, and Rosalie remained standing where he had left her.</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Richard emerged from the
shadowy hollow where he had left his mistress standing as if
turned to stone, he found all the land about him bathed with the
rosy glow of sunset.&nbsp; The long &lsquo;rollers&rsquo; of
newly-cut grass over which he stepped were touched here and there
by arrows of light, and the twigs of the hedge towards which he
made his way were outlined as by fire.</p>
<p>He saw none of these things, however; but when, climbing the
low bank and passing through a gap in the hedge, he descended
into the road, he was suddenly recalled to actualities by the
unexpected appearance of a colossal figure which seemed to be
mounting guard over his bicycle.</p>
<p>As Richard started back Farmer Sharpe rose from his seat on
the bank, and stood <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>square and determined before him,
the ruddy light playing upon his rugged face and shaggy hair and
glorifying his white smock.&nbsp; One great hand still rested on
the saddle of the bicycle, which it almost entirely
covered.&nbsp; As Richard remained dumbly gazing at him, his
fingers began to drum an impatient tune on its smooth
surface.</p>
<p>The young man gazed desperately first at him and then at the
bicycle, filled with an insane desire to possess himself of it
and ride away at full speed.&nbsp; But whether because his
courage failed him, or because nobler and more manly feelings
gained the ascendency over this momentary cowardice, he did not
put the design into execution.</p>
<p>After gazing steadily at his nephew for what seemed an
interminable time, Isaac removed his hand from the bicycle and
pointed in the direction of the little dell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seed &rsquo;ee there, Richard,&rsquo; he remarked in
a sepulchral tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I seed &rsquo;ee there with Mrs.
F.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Richard braced himself, and looked him full in the face, but
made no rejoinder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;I seed ye
both; and I&rsquo;ve been a-waiting here for ye,
Richard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still silence.&nbsp; Richard, indeed, felt that it <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>would be
useless to enter upon either explanation or apology.</p>
<p>Mr. Sharpe&rsquo;s hand crept back to the saddle and resumed
its impatient tune; he planted his legs a little more widely
apart, continuing the while to stare unwinkingly in his
nephew&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>When the tension had become almost unbearable, he spoke
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I &rsquo;d wait for &rsquo;ee here,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought ye &rsquo;d very likely have summat
to say to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man bit his lip and clenched his hands; he could
scarcely brook the expectant look in those eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to say, Uncle Isaac?&nbsp; I&mdash;what can I
say?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going away at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The combined effect of sunshine and emotion had already
intensified the farmer&rsquo;s usually healthy colour, but this
announcement caused it to deepen to a positively alarming
extent.&nbsp; For a moment he seemed in danger of suffocation; he
raised his hand mechanically to the loose collar of his smock and
clutched at it; his eyes seemed ready to start from their
sockets, and, though he opened his mouth and rolled his head from
side to side as though about to fulminate against his nephew, no
words came.</p>
<p><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Richard, much
alarmed&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t be so angry, uncle&mdash;you
really need n&rsquo;t be so much upset.&nbsp; I tell you
I&rsquo;m going away at once&mdash;to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Sharpe sank down on the bank, sliding his legs out
before him rigid as a pair of compasses; his head continued to
roll threateningly, and his eyes to gaze fiercely at Richard, but
it was some time before he could find voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye can&rsquo;t go to-night,&rsquo; he said at last, in
husky, suffocating tones: &lsquo;there bain&rsquo;t no train
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not from Branston, I know; but I mean to ride to
Wimborne, and catch the night train there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somehow this catching of the night train at Wimborne seemed to
be the culminating point of Richard&rsquo;s depravity.&nbsp;
Isaac positively groaned aloud; the fierceness went out of his
eyes, and to Richard&rsquo;s infinite distress they filled with
tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What more can I do?&rsquo; he faltered, torn with
remorse and grief as he bent over him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did n&rsquo;t think it of &rsquo;ee,
Richard&mdash;nay, if anybody had told me ye &rsquo;d go for to
do such a thing I would n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; believed
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; To go <a name="page346"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 346</span>off wi&rsquo;out a word to
I&mdash;me as has been a father to &rsquo;ee&mdash;nay, not so
much as a word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, choked with emotion, and fell to wiping his eyes
and shaking his head disconsolately; while Richard, slowly
straightening himself, stood looking down at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Job Hunt did call me, and did p&rsquo;int out as
you was standin&rsquo;&mdash;you and Mrs. F.&mdash;hand in hand:
both hands in both hands,&rsquo; he added, correcting himself,
&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t let on to take no notice.&nbsp; I did send
Job about his business, and I did say to myself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;My nevvy
&rsquo;ull tell me all about it jist now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I did
go and sit me down here.&nbsp; Says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
interfere; I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;Richard will
out wi&rsquo; it all to I&mdash;he&rsquo;ll act straight,&rdquo;
I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke almost appealingly.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s face, which
had turned from white to red, was now white again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to spare you, uncle,&rsquo; he murmured at
last, falteringly.</p>
<p>Isaac groaned, and shook his head; then drawing a long breath,
and peering anxiously at his nephew, he whispered pleadingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was you a-sayin&rsquo; to Mrs. F. when you was
a-holdin&rsquo; of her hands, Richard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; groaned the other impatiently, &lsquo;there
<a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>are some
things that can&rsquo;t be talked about!&nbsp; I should n&rsquo;t
have held her hands&mdash;I scarcely knew that I was holding
them.&nbsp; What does it matter now?&nbsp; We have said good-bye
to each other for ever; we have made up our minds never to see
each other again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac&rsquo;s jaw dropped; he brought down his fist heavily on
the bank beside him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he muttered under his breath,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m danged!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get no
satisfaction.&nbsp; Not a word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know enough,&rsquo; said Richard fiercely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Be content with what I tell you&mdash;I will never darken
your doors again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isaac brought down his fist once more on the bank, and then
slowly hoisted himself on to his feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ye have n&rsquo;t naught to say to I, I&rsquo;ve
summat to say to you,&rsquo; he announced, speaking very
slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to let
&rsquo;ee go off like that.&nbsp; &rsquo;T is my way to be
straightfor&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak my mind plain to
&rsquo;ee this night, and I&rsquo;ll speak my mind to Mrs.
F.&nbsp; Where be Mrs. F.?&nbsp; Come along of I, Richard, and
find her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had squeezed through the gap in the hedge while still
speaking, and Richard had no choice but to follow him.&nbsp; A
few strides <a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>brought them to the dell, and, looking down, they
descried Rosalie standing in the same attitude as that in which
Richard had left her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Fiander,&rsquo; called Isaac, bending over the
brink, &lsquo;will &rsquo;ee oblige me by stepping up here?&nbsp;
The sides be a bit steep, and I bain&rsquo;t so young as I
were&mdash;I can&rsquo;t very well go down, but I &rsquo;d be
obliged if you &rsquo;d step up.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ve summat to say
to you and my nevvy here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie had started violently at the sound of his voice, and
now obeyed his summons in silence; but she trembled so much, and
the wet grass had become so slippery, that she stumbled often,
and it was some time before she completed the ascent.&nbsp;
Meanwhile both men stood watching her, motionless, and in
silence.&nbsp; Once or twice she had raised her eyes towards the
great white figure which awaited her on the brink, and it seemed
to her that Isaac&rsquo;s face was grave and stern like the face
of a judge.&nbsp; She did not dare once glance at Richard, but
she felt, even without looking at him, that their secret was
discovered.</p>
<p>The farmer backed a little away from the edge of the dell when
Rosalie came forth, and stood looking from one to the other; <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>then he
spoke very solemnly, and with some hesitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Fiander, as I was a-sayin&rsquo; to Richard jist
now, &rsquo;t is best to be
straightfor&rsquo;ard&mdash;&rsquo;ees, &rsquo;t is best to speak
out, even when it be hard to speak out.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get
no satisfaction from Richard&mdash;he did acshally tell I to my
face as he had made up his mind to go straight off wi&rsquo;out a
single word to I.&nbsp; He comes wi&rsquo;out a word and he goes
wi&rsquo;out a word!&nbsp; Now, Mrs. F., I did see you together
jist now, and I did think as you &rsquo;d have summat to tell
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a long pause.&nbsp; Isaac looked once more from
Rosalie&rsquo;s graceful, shrinking figure to the other culprit,
who stood with bent head, awaiting the storm of reproach and
vituperation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the very first,&rsquo; pursued Isaac, still in
that solemn and somewhat stern tone, &lsquo;I did tell &rsquo;ee
my mind plain, Mrs. Fiander.&nbsp; I did tell &rsquo;ee straight
out, did n&rsquo;t I? as I had n&rsquo;t never fixed my thoughts
on materimony.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was you as was set on
it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I know,&rsquo; interrupted Rosalie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know it too well.&nbsp; Do not throw it in my face
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Throw it in your face, Mrs. F.!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
a-throwing o&rsquo; what in your face?&nbsp; All I do say is I
did al&rsquo;ays do my best for &rsquo;ee&mdash;don&rsquo;t <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>you go for
to blame me, for blame I do not deserve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both raised their heads and looked at him, astonished at the
change of tone, for now the old man seemed to speak more in
sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did al&rsquo;ays do my best for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; I
did al&rsquo;ays think and act as kind as I could, and you did
never once think of I.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees, I did never
interfere,&rsquo; he went on, more emphatically; &lsquo;I left ye
both to yourselves&mdash;did n&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I never comed in
your way.&nbsp; But ye mid ha&rsquo; given me a
thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The penitent heads drooped again.&nbsp; What need had they to
be reminded how guileless he had been, how unsuspicious, how
chivalrous in thought and deed!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; went on Isaac, &lsquo;I did leave ye
to yourselves&mdash;I did ax ye to make friends.&nbsp; Do you
mind how often I axed ye to be friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>True indeed; only too true!&nbsp; They had taken a base
advantage of his confidence; they had profited of the
opportunities he had given them only to be more and more
unfaithful to him in their hearts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you &rsquo;d be different to what you do
be,&rsquo; he continued, with increasing severity.&nbsp; <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>&lsquo;When
Sam&rsquo;el Cross did tell I as you &rsquo;d snap up Mrs. F.,
Richard, what did I say?&nbsp; Says I, &ldquo;My nevvy
bain&rsquo;t a snapper!&rdquo;&nbsp; D&rsquo; ye mind?&nbsp; I
said the same thing to you.&nbsp; Well, I thought maybe you
&rsquo;d say summat then&mdash;but not a word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle, I&mdash;it is n&rsquo;t fair to reproach me like
this.&nbsp; I kept away from Littlecomb as long as I could; you
know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, I do know it, Richard&mdash;I know it very
well; you would n&rsquo;t come with me when I did ax &rsquo;ee
that Sunday.&nbsp; You would n&rsquo;t come along o&rsquo; me to
Littlecomb; nay, but you went out by yourself that night, and
when you comed back ye would n&rsquo;t so much as sit down and
smoke a pipe like an honest Christian; and next day you must get
up and go off wi&rsquo; yourself before &rsquo;t were
light.&nbsp; And what did I do then&mdash;what did I do, Richard,
though you &rsquo;d gone off and left me wi&rsquo;out so much as
a line?&nbsp; I did n&rsquo;t give up hopes of &rsquo;ee
yet.&nbsp; I went and wrote &rsquo;ee a letter and told &rsquo;ee
to come back, and all &rsquo;ud be forgive and forgot.&nbsp;
There now, and what do &rsquo;ee say to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His face was working with emotion, his voice tremulous for all
its strength.&nbsp; Never in his life, probably, had Isaac Sharpe
put so <a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>many words together, and every one of them came from
his heart.&nbsp; To the young people it seemed as though all
their struggles had been futile, their good desires vain, their
great sacrifice useless: for all their days they would be branded
with infamy.&nbsp; They had, indeed, stopped short of the breach
of faith to which both had been so strongly tempted, but they had
nevertheless violated trust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And even now,&rsquo; said Isaac&mdash;&lsquo;even at
the very last, when you were for cuttin&rsquo; off wi&rsquo;out
no explanation, I did give &rsquo;ee one more chance&mdash;and
you would n&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What in Heaven&rsquo;s name do you want to say?&rsquo;
cried Richard, goaded to desperation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you want me
to tell you to your face that I love the woman you are going to
marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay now,&rsquo; returned his uncle in an expostulatory
tone, &lsquo;I would n&rsquo;t go so far as that.&nbsp; I
bain&rsquo;t onreasonable.&nbsp; All I did ever think o&rsquo;
axin&rsquo; ye was for you and Mrs. F. to see if ye could
n&rsquo;t take to each other.&nbsp; That were my notion.&nbsp; Ye
might ha&rsquo; gived each other a fair trial&mdash;a fair
trial!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young couple stared at him blankly, hardly believing their
ears; then Richard cried out with a gasp: <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>&lsquo;Rosalie, do you hear&mdash;do you
understand?&nbsp; He <i>wanted</i> us to love each
other!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; interrupted the farmer, in a tone that was
at once dignified and explanatory, &lsquo;I did n&rsquo;t expect
so much straight off&mdash;Love!&nbsp; No, no, not love&mdash;but
ye mid ha&rsquo; jist tried to fancy one another!&nbsp; Ye mid
ha&rsquo; had a bit o&rsquo; consideration for me, I think.&nbsp;
Ye knowed, both on ye, as materimony would n&rsquo;t come easy to
I; and seein&rsquo; as you did tell me plain, Richard, the very
first night you come home, as you was on the look-out for a wife,
why not Mrs. F. so well as another?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was Rosalie&rsquo;s turn to gasp now, and her face bloomed
like a rose in the evening light; but neither she nor Richard
spoke; both were so suddenly brought down from their heights of
heroics that it was natural they should feel somewhat dizzy and
confused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a man o&rsquo; my word,&rsquo; said Isaac,
&lsquo;and if ye have made up your mind and fixed your
ch&rsquo;ice on I, Mrs. F., why&rsquo;&mdash;drawing a deep
breath&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise, my dear.&nbsp;
But if Richard &rsquo;ud do so well as me &rsquo;t &rsquo;ud be a
deal more convenient, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud seem a
bit queer to change my state at my time o&rsquo; life, and to
leave the old home where I was born and bred.&nbsp; And Richard,
<a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>he has a
very good notion o&rsquo; farmin&rsquo;, and he &rsquo;d be
willing to carry on the work in the old way, and to take advice
from I, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp; Ah, the notion did come to I soon
arter he comed here.&nbsp; Thinks I to myself, I wonder if
Richard &rsquo;ud do&mdash;&rsquo;t &rsquo;ud be a deal more
suitable, thinks I; and more satisfactory to all
parties.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Isaac was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter from
his nephew&mdash;laughter which was indeed the outlet of such an
extraordinary mixture of emotions that they had nearly found vent
in tears.&nbsp; The exquisite sense of relief, the unhoped-for
joy stirred his very heart&rsquo;s depths; but, on the other
hand, the humour of the situation struck him with almost equal
force.&nbsp; After the overwhelming remorse, the bitter sense of
shame which but a few moments ago had tortured them, to discover
that their contemplated sacrifice had very nearly set at naught
good old Isaac&rsquo;s dearest wish!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, uncle, uncle!&rsquo; he cried as soon as the first
ecstatic outburst of mirth had subsided, &lsquo;why did you not
speak before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;T would n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been very
becomin&rsquo; for me to speak,&rsquo; returned the farmer, still
with great dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knowed my dooty to Mrs. F., <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>and I were
n&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to say nothin&rsquo; as mid hurt her
feelin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But I did try and bring ye together,
Richard; and I did try to give ye so many hints as I could.&nbsp;
D&rsquo; ye mind how often I did say what a dear woman Mrs. F.
were, and what a good wife she &rsquo;d make?&nbsp; Ah, many a
time I did.&nbsp; And d&rsquo; ye mind how I used to tell
&rsquo;ee it was bad to hurt a woman&rsquo;s
feelin&rsquo;s?&nbsp; And you would n&rsquo;t take a bit o&rsquo;
pains to be friendly and pleasant wi&rsquo; her!&nbsp; I did look
for some return from &rsquo;ee, Richard, and I were
disapp&rsquo;inted.&nbsp; And I did expect at least as ye would
tell me straight whether you could take to the notion or whether
ye could n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;T was the least ye mid do, I
think.&nbsp; I were that anxious, and that upset&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t see as it&rsquo;s any laughin&rsquo; matter,&rsquo;
he continued with gathering wrath, for Rosalie&rsquo;s face was
now dimpling all over with smiles and Richard&rsquo;s hilarity
seemed to increase rather than diminish.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come,
I&rsquo;ll have a straight answer one way or t&rsquo;
other.&nbsp; Will ye give up this here stupid notion o&rsquo;
going out o&rsquo; the country, Richard, and bide here and see if
you and Mrs. F. can&rsquo;t make it up between ye?&nbsp; And you,
Mrs. F., my dear, will &rsquo;ee jist think over this here
matter, and see if Richard would n&rsquo;t do as well as
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>Richard suddenly ceased laughing, and stepped to
Rosalie&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you, Rosalie?&rsquo; he said, very gently and
tenderly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you try to like me a
little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, without waiting for an answer, he took her hands and laid
them softly about his own neck, and stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear heart alive!&rsquo; exclaimed Isaac, clapping his
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;That were n&rsquo;t sich a bad beginning,
Richard, I will say!&nbsp; You bain&rsquo;t very slack once you
do make a start.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused to laugh, long and
loud.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nay, Richard, ye don&rsquo;t do things by halves.&nbsp;
Well, Mrs. F., my dear,&rsquo; he added, more anxiously, seeing
that Rosalie did not speak, &lsquo;what d&rsquo; ye
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; returned Rosalie faintly, with her
face half hidden on Richard&rsquo;s shoulder, &lsquo;I suppose
I&rsquo;ll have to try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do &rsquo;ee now, my dear,&rsquo; cried Isaac, much
relieved.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll find ye won&rsquo;t
<i>re</i>-pent it.&nbsp; And ye&rsquo;ll not lose nothing by it
neither,&rsquo; he added as an afterthought.&nbsp; &lsquo;Richard
be jist the same as a son to I&mdash;he&rsquo;ll have all as I
&rsquo;ve a-got to leave when I be gone.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
for to seem unkind, but it &rsquo;ud be a very great comfort to
me if ye could make up your mind to&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>&lsquo;Oh, I think,&rsquo; murmured Rosalie,
&lsquo;that I can make up my mind to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; cried Isaac, chuckling and rubbing
his hands, &lsquo;all&rsquo;s well as ends well!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees, we may say that&mdash;all&rsquo;s well as ends
well!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be the best o&rsquo; friends as ever; but
I do think as Richard &rsquo;ull be more suitable as a husband,
my dear.&nbsp; Ye mid as well see Mrs. F. home now,
Richard.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go back to my bit o&rsquo;
supper; &rsquo;t will be cold enough by now, I reckon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a nod and a broad smile he left them, and pursued his
homeward way, pausing ever and anon to look backwards at the two
lithe young figures which moved slowly along above the dark
irregular line of hedge&mdash;the bent heads, very close
together, outlined against the lambent evening sky.&nbsp; Once,
after one of these backward glances, he began to chuckle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve a-took to the notion nicely,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Ees, I reckon they&rsquo;ll
do!&rsquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
